          </Typography>

          <Typography tag="p" className="">
            This Privacy Policy is based on the terminology established by
            European legislation, particularly the GDPR, to ensure clarity and
            accessibility for the general public, as well as our members and
            users. To ensure this, kindly refer to the terminology used
            hereunder, as per below:
            <br />
            <br />
            a) Personal data
            <br />
            <br />
            Personal data means any information relating to an identified or
            identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”). An identifiable
            natural person is someone who can be identified, directly or
            indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
            name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier,
            or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
            genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
            natural person.
            <br />
            <br />
            b) Data Subject
            <br />
            <br />
            Data Subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose
            personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the
            processing.
            <br />
            <br />
            c) Processing
            <br />
            <br />
            Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed
            on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by
            automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation,
            structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,
            consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or
            otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction,
            erasure or destruction.
            <br />
            <br />
            d) Restriction of processing
            <br />
            <br />
            Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data
            with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
            <br />
            <br />
            e) Profiling
            <br />
            <br />
            Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data
            consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal
            aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or
            predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at
            work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests,
            reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
            <br />
            <br />
            f) Pseudonymisation
            <br />
            <br />
            Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner
            that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific
            data subject without the use of additional information, provided
            that such additional information is kept separately and is subject
            to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal
            data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural
            person.
            <br />
            <br />
            g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing
            <br />
            <br />
            Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the
            natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
            which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and
            means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and
            means of such processing are determined by European Union or Member
            State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its
            nomination may be provided for by European Union or Member State
            law.
            <br />
            <br />
            h) Processor
            <br />
            <br />
            Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or
            other body which processes personal data on behalf of the

            <br />
            <br />
            i) Recipient
            <br />
            <br />
            Recipient is any natural or legal person, public authority, agency

            personal data in the context of a particular inquiry in accordance
            with European Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
            recipients; the processing of these data by the public authorities
            shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules
            according to the purposes of the processing.
            <br />
            <br />
            j) Third party
            <br />
            <br />
            Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency
            or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and
            persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or
            processor, are authorised to process personal data.
            <br />
            <br />
            k) Consent
            <br />
            <br />
            Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed
            and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he
            or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies
            agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.
            <br />
            <br />
            l) Cross-border processing

            <br />
            Cross-border processing means either: (i) processing of personal
            data which takes place in the context of the activities of
            establishments in more than one Member State of a controller or

            established in more than one Member State; or (ii) processing of
            personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of
            a single establishment of a controller or processor in the Union but
            which substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect
            data subjects in more than one Member State.
            <br />

            concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a
            structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she
            shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller
            without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data
            have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent
            pursuant to point (a) of Art. 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Art.
            9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article
            6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated
            means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the
            performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
            exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
            <br />
            <br />
            Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability
            pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the Data Subject shall have
            the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one
            controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so
            does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
            <br />
            <br />
            g) Right to object
            <br />
            <br />
            Each Data Subject shall have the right to object, on grounds
            relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to
            processing of personal. This also applies to profiling based on
            these provisions.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Data Controller shall no longer process the personal data in the
            event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling
            legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests,
            rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment,
            exercise or defence of legal claims.

            data concerning him or her for scientific or historical research
            purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of
            the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of
            a task carried out for reasons of public interest.

            <br />
            h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
            <br />
            <br />
            Each Data Subject shall have the right not to be subject to a
            decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling,
            which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly
            significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not
            necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract
            between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not
            authorised by European Union or Member State law to which the
            controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to
            safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate
            interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject’s explicit
            consent.

            If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the

            Controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject’s explicit
            consent, the Data Controller shall implement suitable measures to
            safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate
            interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the
            part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and
            contest the decision.
