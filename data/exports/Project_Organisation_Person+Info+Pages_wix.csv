Almost all of our forecasting questions were developed in cooperation with 16 different public institutions and ministerial departments. Each institution or department defined its most useful forecasting topics, participated in a workshop to define specific questions with us, and was later provided with the results. This was intended as a proof of concept of one possible approach to incorporating forecasting in public decision-making.</p>
<p><br>Once defined, our forecasting questions were then posted on a private Metaculus sub-domain (in Czech), where an average of 72 forecasters had the opportunity to address them as they would any other question on Metaculus (median of 18 predictions per user). Throughout the tournament, we produced 16 reports detailing the rationales and forecasts, to be used by the cooperating institutions.<br>A handful of our partners have already reported acting on the information/judgment presented in our reports. This has concerned, for example, the national foreclosure issue (some 6% of the total population have debts in arrears) where the debt relief process is being redesigned midst strong lobbying and insufficient personal capacities; or the probabilities of outlier scenarios for European macroeconomic development, which was requested by the Slovak Ministry of Finance to help calibrate their existing judgements.</p>
<p><br>It also seems useful to explore various approaches to grow the number of policymakers with personal experience and skills in forecasting. In our case, we found curiosity and willingness to try forecasting even in unexpected institutional locations (i.e. the Czech R&amp;amp;I funding body). This makes us more confident that the “external forecasts” approach (as compared to building internal prediction tournaments or focusing on advancing forecasting skills of public servants) is worth investigating further precisely because it allows us to detect and draw on this interest irrespective of institutional and seniority distinctions and resource constraints.<br>While we hope that any readers with an interest in forecasting may find our experience useful, we expect that both this and any future projects of ours make it easier for other teams to work towards similar goals. To that effect, the write-up also contains an Annex of “Methodological Guidelines,” where we outline in more explicit terms the questions and decisions that we found were important to tackle when running the project, and what they may entail.</p>

<p>Successfully managing the green and digital transitions is a crucial factor that could increase the resilience and strategic autonomy of the EU and shape its future. Yet the digitalisation of agriculture and rural areas raises vital questions about winners and losers, costs, benefits, and long-term implications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>European Commission’s foresight project coordinated by <a href=""https://policy-lab.ec.europa.eu/index_en"" target=""_blank"">EU Policy Lab</a> together with the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) in 2023-2024 explored the interplay between digital transition, policies and the resilience of the agricultural sector and rural areas, against the backdrop of potential disruptive and transformative changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital transition will occur in a rapidly changing world faced with climate change, environmental degradation, geopolitical instability, shifting supply networks, and evolving consumer demand. This study's foresight scenarios suggest that digitalisation can catalyse transformation, aiding in coping with shocks, knowledge acquisition, community building, and system-related thinking. But at the same time, it can also reinforce inequalities and introduce rigidities. Therefore, digitalisation support should aim to create sustainable food systems and robust, connected, and prosperous rural areas and communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sound digital transition strategy should promote agricultural and rural resilience, green transition, digital citizenship for farmers and communities, and overall well-being. Digitalisation should uphold values like trust, equality, power, sovereignty, and care. Its execution should prioritise collaboration, accessibility, people-centric design, and circularity. Key enablers for a successful digital transition include capacity building for digital skills, fostering a robust digital ecosystem, investing in infrastructure and connectivity, and securing sufficient funding.&nbsp;</p>

Selection of the drivers of change</strong> <br>The working groups explored and enriched a list of factors/trends that influence the contextual change toward the 2035 horizon, across various dimensions: social, technological, economic, ecological, geopolitical, and values-based factors.<br><br>3. <strong>Scenario projection for 2035</strong>  <br> Based on thematically grouped change drivers, the working groups envisioned and described the state of mountain areas in 2035 under the influence of these drivers, in the absence of strategic corrective interventions.<br><br><strong>4. Identification of aspirations – key values, opportunities, best practices</strong>  <br> The groups proposed and debated a series of values and aspirations for the future of mountain areas by 2035, including inspiration from best practices in other countries.<br><br><strong>5. Consolidation of aspirations into clear directions for transforming mountain areas</strong><br>   This stage involved grouping aspirations by thematic areas, more clearly articulating the transformation vector, and partially exploring concrete actions that would enable these transformations. The sum of these transformation directions forms the **Vision for mountain areas by 2035**.<br><br><strong>6. Roadmapping</strong> - includes the set of actions that support progress toward the desirable transformation of the mountain areas, across multiple levels.<br><br><strong>7.

","<p>The project responded to a highly topical and significant need of public administration regarding the availability of timely and relevant information on dynamically developing technological and socio-economic changes for the strategic management of research and innovation policy. Very fast and dynamic changes and their possible impacts need to be predicted and responded to in a timely and flexible manner. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically monitor technological and social trends and identify in advance the resulting opportunities and potential threats to socio-economic development. The aim of the project was to develop a system for continuous monitoring and evaluation of technological trends and collection of signals associated with technological changes with a potential impact on the Czech economy and society. The project output is a unique horizon scanning tool in the Czech environment combining the latest methods in the field of data science with elements of expert assessment based on participatory methods used in prospective studies. The result of the project (and the newly created horizon scanning tool) is the ability to continuously identify and analyze emerging technological trends and emerging technologies and assess their impacts on the Czech economy and society. The expected impact of the project is to strengthen strategic management in public administration by a prospective component of monitoring the medium- and long-term horizon of technological and social development, thereby making the implementation of research and innovation policy in the Czech Republic more efficient.</p>

Starting in autumn 2019, five Foresight on Demand projects supported them with foresight expertise and methodology. This project provides the work in support of the Mission Board on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities. Starting with a systemic analysis, the project identified urban challenges in existing forward-looking studies in order to determine the thematic scope together with the Mission Board. It collected data about consolidated external and internal drivers, trends and practices as well as weak signals, potential disruptive events or incremental changes with a potentially substantial positive impact on cities.</p>

<p>The futures consciousness concept and scale has been developed by researchers at the Finland Futures Research Centre (University of Turku) and University of Geneva, with help from other contributors. Teach the Future received a grant from the World Futures Studies Federation (WFSF) and the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University (PMU) to adapt the Scale for use by young people, ages 12-18.  The results of that grant are being submitted for publication by the partners. After that, the Scale will be available for use by schools and other organizations that work with youth. The details will be published on this page shortly.<br>Take the<a href=""https://fctest.utu.fi/"" target=""_blank""> test</a>.<br>The  Five Dimensions of Futures Consciousness are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>time perspective</strong>; the ability to be aware of the past, present and future, as well as the way events follow each other over time</li>
<li><strong>agency beliefs</strong>; basic sense of confidence that an individual has in their own ability to influence the external world</li>
<li><strong>openness to alternatives</strong>; abilities used to critically question commonly accepted ideas and influences an individual’s willingness to consider alternative ways of being and doing</li>
<li><strong>systems perception</strong>; the ability to recognize human and natural systems around us including groups, societies and ecosystems</li>
<li><strong>concern for others</strong>; relates to the degree to which an individual pursues favourable futures for a group beyond themselves<br></li>
</ul>

","<p><strong>TRIGGER specific objectives are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Advance the state of the art in understanding global governance;</li>
<li>Evolution of the EU’s interaction with global governance, in particular so-called “actorness” and “effectiveness” of the EU;</li>
<li>Understand how global governance and emerging technologies interact, and what role the EU plays in this respect, in particular as “regulatory superpower”;</li>
<li>Identify emerging trends that strengthen / loosen deeper global governance and cooperation;</li>
<li>Build capacity for strategic foresight and public engagement inside EU institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TRIGGER consortium is composed of 14 partners, including four non-EU countries. TRIGGER will achieve its objectives thanks to the combined effort of four research sub-groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>a group focused on global and EU governance, which will create an unprecedented Atlas of Global Governance REGulation and Europe’s AcTORness (AGGREGATOR);</li>
<li>a group focused on the relationship between governance and emerging technologies;&nbsp;</li>
<li>a group dedicated to strategic foresight and public engagement, which will use new techniques such as AI-enabled sentiment analysis and innovative public engagement methods to develop a tool on Co-Creating the European Union (COCTEAU); and</li>
<li>a group specialised in dissemination and communication. All major deliverables will eventually be merged into a toolkit dedicated to Public Engagement for Responsive and Shared EU Strategies (PERSEUS).</li>

Building on existing future-oriented work, the project employed dedicated foresight methods, in particular workshops and a Delphi survey, to explore this time horizon in a systematic manner, and involving experts and stakeholders as appropriate.</p>
<p>Climate Adaptation refers to anticipating the adverse effects of climate change and taking appropriate action to prevent or minimise the damage they can cause, or taking advantage of opportunities that may arise. It has been shown that well-planned, early adaptation action later saves money, lives, livelihoods, and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The foresight was based on the European Commission (EC) White Paper “Adapting to climate change: Towards a European framework for action” of 2009, and on the EU climate adaptation strategy adopted in 2013. At the time of the formulation of this strategy, the economic, environmental, and social costs of not adapting to climate change were estimated to range from 100 billion € a year in 2020 to 250 billion € a year in 2050, for the EU as a whole. Meanwhile, the EC in February 2021 elaborated and adopted a new climate adaptation strategy, which focuses on developing solutions and implementation of adaptation measures.</p>
<p>Research directions: Climate change adaptation (CCA) including societal transformation covers a broad range of areas, such as agriculture, dealing with water resources, disaster prevention, migration flows, security issues, behaviour changes, urban areas, industry and trade relations, transforming the energy system and transportation. The thematic scope of the foresight exercise was defined in close collaboration with the Mission Board (MB) through the Mission Board Secretariat. Consequently, the Delphi survey implemented in summer 2020 was used to assess elements of the interim MB report, in particular items around risk management, financial risk protection, social infrastructure, health, water, food/agriculture, and ecosystems. All the work fed into the final report of the Mission Board “A Climate Resilient Europe - Prepare Europe for climate disruptions and accelerate the transformation to a climate resilient and just Europe by 2030” (2020).</p>

Through this broad engagement, the study did not only develop intelligence for the 2nd Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe but also contributed to the development of an EU R&amp;I foresight community hosted by futures4europe.eu, one that is an asset for future R&amp;I policies across Europe.<br><br>The foresight process in support of the 2nd Strategic Plan comprised a wide spectrum of activities:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>As a reference point for the exploratory work, the explicit and implicit impact assumptions of the 1st Strategic Plan were identified and visualised with the help of a qualitative system analysis and modelling tool for causal loop analysis.</li>
<li>An exploratory analysis of forward-looking sources (e.g. foresight reports, web-based horizon scanning) was conducted to identify relevant trends and signals of unexpected developments. These were discussed in online workshops and on futures4europe.eu.</li>
<li>An outlook on emerging developments in the global and European context of EU R&amp;I policy was developed drawing on a major online workshop in autumn 2021 with some 60 participants, experts and policy makers, who worked with multi-level context scenarios and specific context narratives about emerging disruptions.</li>
<li>On that basis and in close consultation with the European Commission involving another major workshop in February 2022 which brought together 80 participants, Expert Teams were set up to develop disruptive scenarios in five areas of major interest. Each team ran several internal workshops but also involved further experts and Commission staff in their work, both through the online platform and through a final policy-oriented workshop. The foresight work within the five areas of interest resulted in deep dives on the following topics:<br>&gt; <em>Climate change, Research, and Innovation: Radical Options from Social Change to Geoengineering</em><br>&gt; <em>Hydrogen Economy – A radical alternative</em><br>&gt; <em>The EU in a Volatile New World - The challenge of global leadership</em> <br>&gt; <em>Global Commons</em><br>&gt; <em>Transhumanist Revolutions</em><br></li>
<li>Further areas of interest identified were explored through review papers aiming to capture major trends, developments and scenario sketches in relation to further disruptive developments:<br>    &gt; <em>Social Confrontations</em><br>    &gt; <em>Artificial General Intelligence: Issues and Opportunities</em><br>    &gt; <em>The Interpenetration of Criminal and Lawful Economic Activities </em><br>    &gt; <em>The Future of Health</em><br></li>
<li>A third major workshop took place in October 2022 bringing together all the thematic strands of work and addressing possible R&amp;I policy implications from this work. Participation in this workshop reached 250 individuals over 2 days.</li>
<li>Building on the workshop, the online Dynamic Argumentative Delphi survey Research4Futures collected suggestions from almost 950 contributors from Europe and beyond about the implications of this foresight work for the priorities of EU R&amp;I policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed description of the foresight work and the resulting outputs are available in the final report of the project. <br><br>This foresight study has been implemented through the Foresight on Demand framework contract, by a team of 40 experts. About 300 additional experts contributed to the project through its numerous workshops that helped shape the scenarios and their policy implications.&nbsp;</p>

This project from the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) EU Policy Lab starting 2023 presents a foresight approach to increase preparedness for unexpected developments and the risks they could create.</p>
","<p>Foresight methods offer a way to consider and focus on risks that may be beyond the scope of traditional quantitative and qualitative risk assessment approaches. Several snapshots of the future depict different worlds that have undergone substantial changes as a consequence of emerging developments. An analysis of the risks inherent in the possible futures identified ten risk clusters that are relevant for decision makers, and mapped future developments that might lead to them.The same development pathways that could lead to risks can also create opportunities, and the study provides some examples. Decision makers face the challenge of mitigating the adverse effects of risks, while reaping the benefits of potential opportunities. This study also presents the results of a Delphi survey that evaluated the scope and severity of risks. Three of the 40 risks identified in this study were assessed to be potentially existential for humanity: 1) environmental degradation, 2) environmental disasters, and 3) loss of power by humans. The project started in 2023 and will run until 2024.</p>

<p>In order to find answers to the complex questions of uncertain future developments the foresight team combined several approaches of foresight for anticipatory governance. This includes a systematic horizon scanning of existing reports for weak signals of change in all fields of society such as societal developments, technology, economy, environment, policy and values. The literature and data based information collection was combined with explorative exercises like a scenario development, a visioning process and a gap analysis to develop new ideas for policy options. The engagement of stakeholders and experts on consumer policy was<br>crucial throughout the whole process, in particular for the analysis of influencing factors, alternative scenarios<br>and suggestions for policy actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its anticipatory and exploratory nature, the study was a pilot project for the implementation of comprehensive strategic foresight in DG JUST. Accordingly, the project was also used to build capacity for foresight in dealing with future uncertainty. Representatives of several departments of the DG actively participated in the workshops in all four steps of the process and thus got to know and tested the methods of foresight. These include participatory and qualitative foresight methods such as horizon scanning and scoping for identifying key future trends, scenario and vision development for exploring different possible futures and identifying challenges, and roadmapping approaches for developing options for action. Another important element of the study was the intensive involvement of stakeholders in all steps of the process, especially in the development and discussion of future scenarios and in the development of new policy ideas.</p>
<p>The DG can use the various results of the Foresight process for the further future-proof implementation of the New Consumer Agenda. The trends examined for the scenarios can be reviewed at regular intervals with regard to new developments and impacts on consumption and consumer protection. The scenarios provide an overview of possible futures of consumption in Europe after the COVID-19 pandemic and serve for exploring<br>the scope of possible developments. The visions for consumer protection and empowerment, especially of vulnerable groups and consumers with special needs, summarise stakeholders' expectations for consumer policy in the next 10 years. The action fields prioritised together with stakeholders for consumer policy in and after the pandemic and the ideas for policy actions can now be used by the EC to set its own priorities and develop ideas into concrete actions. The EC may not want to take up all the ideas presented here, but the suggestions can provide guidance on which issues are of high importance from a stakeholder perspective in the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>The Research Council of Norway (RCN) identified five strategic areas in pursuit of ground-breaking research, radical innovation and sustainable development. RCN required a robust evidence base to help develop long-term, priority missions to help solve one or more societal challenges, as well as underpinning structural measures of the research environment in Norway. The five strategic areas include: Oceans; Green transition; Health and welfare; Cohesion and globalisation; and Technology and digitalisation.</p>
<p><strong>How did we approach it?</strong></p>
<p>We adopted a mixed method, participatory approach involving a variety of research tools such as trend analyses, literature reviews, stakeholder interviews, focus groups, crowdsourcing ideas from experts, a survey of the public, future scenario analyses and workshops.</p>
<p>The core foresight work allowed us to examine what might happen in the next ten years in the different strategic areas and wider R&amp;I system in Norway. Scenarios of future states were used as the basis for workshop discussions to stress test potential missions and structural measures that the RCN could consider developing and implementing in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What was the outcome or impact of the work?</strong></p>
<p>Extensive findings from this research were published in a series of nine reports. The research was cited as evidence in the RCN’s input to the 2022 revision of the Long-Term Plan for Research and Higher Education 2019–2028, which specifies the Norwegian government’s ambitions, key objectives and priority areas for research and higher education.</p>
<p>The study also helped inform the RCN’s internal decision making, strategies and organisational activities. In addition, a summary of the findings and proposals was presented to the relevant Norwegian minister.</p>

<p>The aim of the project was to scan the horizon for emerging issues that may affect what urban mobility might look like in Europe in 2050. Furthermore, implications of these possible developments for air quality, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, noise, land use, and in turn for the health and well-being of the inhabitants of European cities were explored. The emerging issues identified contributed to some of the key questions that were identified as part of the EEA’s urban Sustainability Conceptual Framework, such as how cities can look past the personal car era and reimagine their streets as pathway for recovery, built around walking, biking, and public transit. The outcomes of the project included six factsheets on emerging issues related to urban mobility and their impact on health and the environment, including trends, uncertainties and impacts for environment, health and related policy making, including sources of evidence, as well as three possible narratives with visuals on urban mobility in 2050, where two or more of the emerging issues are combined in different but meaningful ways, and a final short report describing the methodology and references used.</p>
<p>FOD EEA Urban Mobility 2:</p>
<p>The purpose of the project was to strengthen the outputs of the previous contract (European urban mobility 2050), which covered a horizon scan for emerging issues that may affect what urban mobility might look like in Europe in 2050. Specifically, the study produced a strengthened and enriched version of the six emerging issues identified and developed in the previous contract, two additional emerging issues identified as part of the previous contract but not developed, namely ‘New and upcoming business models for delivery and mobility‘, and ‘Combination of V2X and IoT’, mind-map representations of the three narratives identified in the previous contract illustrating the key elements, connections and implications on health and environment at three spatial levels: individual, city, and regional / network of cities, and a 4-page briefing that summarises the process and outputs from this contract and the previous one. The briefing was designed to inform EEA’s audience of the ongoing forward-looking work associated with urban mobility.<br></p>

This uncertainty demands a strategic approach to guide decision-making in the European manufacturing industry up to 2040. In this context, the MASTT2040 project uses inclusive foresight methods to build a shared understanding, engage key stakeholders, and craft a strategic roadmap, addressing short, medium, and long-term goals.

","<p>The aim of this study was to serve as one of the inputs to the update and to initiate a discussion on the possibilities of updating the Czech republic 2030 strategy. In order to ensure that this strategic document reflects the dynamic developments on the global and domestic scene, mechanisms for regular reviews and updates of the objectives and measures have been proposed. Given the events of the last 3 years (especially the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine), it is relevant to review the relevance of the assumptions regarding the long-term development of the Czech Republic, which served as the basis for the original wording of the strategic objectives and targeting of the document.<br>The role of České priority was to provide foresight exercises in order to reach two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess the relevance of existing goals:</strong> the problems and challenges facing society are changing and so are the definition of objectives for further development. The task of this section is therefore also to determine whether the original ČR 2030 goals are still relevant in the context of change and respond to the major challenges that society is facing and will continue to face in the coming decades.</li>
<li><strong>Identify blind spots: </strong>there may be issues or opportunities that the document does not cover - i.e. blind spots. The next task of this part of the update is to identify such gaps to increase the comprehensiveness of the document.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project was implemented in the form of workshops, which were attended by experts and representatives of public institutions and ministries. On the basis of pre-prepared scenarios of development, the participants had to identify the resulting challenges, opportunities and areas that have not yet been covered in the CR 2030. The list of these areas was subsequently consulted with representatives of public institutions. These expert consultations were complemented by input from the general public through a creative competition held in September 2022.</p>

The aim of the study was to analyse the status of future generations and their rights in current legislative processes, and to map and compare practices for foresight and consideration of future generations in different political contexts, nationally and internationally. The purpose of the project was to increase understanding on i) how future generations can be better taken into account in policymaking; ii) how foresight can be better utilised in lawmaking. FORGE’s conceptual and analytical structure is pictured in the figure 1.</p>
","<p>The FORGE-project is unique – there has not previously been a study with a similar scope in Finland and comparable international examples are, to the best knowledge of the authors, extremely rare. FORGE supported the preparation of the second part of the Government Report on the Future. The project was funded by the Government’s analysis, assessment and research activities (VN TEAS) and was conducted during 1/2022–11/2022 by researchers of the University of Turku, Åbo Akademi University and Tampere University.</p>

Not only courts and social movements worldwide are calling for a strengthening of forward-looking and provident governance. Many political actors within and outside the German government are also demanding a strengthening of capacities for long-term thinking and action in order to better meet the major challenges of the 21st century. How can we succeed in making policy more forward-looking? How can we strengthen our ability to deal with uncertainty and complexity? How would processes and structures have to change to achieve this? What role can strategic foresight (SF) play here?<br>These questions were addressed in the study conducted by the Fraunhofer ISI Foresight Team together with Prof. Sylvia Veit (administrative scientist at the University of Kassel) on behalf of the Federal Chancellery.<br>The aim was to examine the status quo in Germany and to develop various options for institutionalising strategic foresight as a process, method and approach in the German government's policy and administration, and to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages. This should create a basis for discussion for the further anchoring of strategic foresight in government action.<br></p>

The current structure is insufficient to address the emerging challenges of nourishing people in a healthy and sustainable way. Key objective is to gain insights into how it can be built to be more inclusive and better governed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FOSTER shall help to transform Europe’s food system outcomes and will achieve this by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>building a FOSTER Platform including food system-state of the art knowledge, foresight by semi-automated Horizon scanning, trend and threats-analysis and new multi-dimensional scenarios of EU food systems to 2040;&nbsp;</li>
<li>implementing the FOSTER Academy – including four Summer Schools – for integrating food system-related disciplines and citizen science to enhance food system understanding across the ERA;&nbsp;</li>
<li>initiating and assessing a co-creation and co-learning process within six national resp. regional Citizen Driven Initiatives (CDIs), in which new knowledge, strategies and Action Research Agendas are gained;&nbsp;</li>
<li>scaling out and deep CDIs solutions and approaches to other territorial contexts;&nbsp;</li>
<li>studying different R&amp;I mechanisms of policy support for mission-oriented R&amp;I policy for food systems transformation, and analysing and ground-proofing them in each CDI;&nbsp;</li>
<li>strengthening science-policy interfaces by co-learning processes with external experts and developing recommendations for food systems R&amp;I policies tailored to different geographies and sectors;&nbsp;</li>
<li>identifying the trigger points to help ‘unlock’ system lock-ins and support further dynamics towards system transformation;&nbsp;</li>
<li>and applying reflective monitoring on all FOSTER’s co-learning activities to develop insights into how the KIS can be broadened from an agricultural-KIS to a food system-KIS. <br></li>
</ul>
<p>To inspire adoption of FOSTER learnings, over 20 workshops and a final conference will be conducted; scientific position papers and policy briefs will be widely communicated.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Building a common understanding</strong> of the current societal/consumer behaviors and attitudes (level of fish and seafood consumption, types of products consumed, preference for local products, expectations regarding traceability, environmental concerns etc.);</li>
<li><strong>Assessing the evolution</strong> of societal/consumer expectations by 2035 (on the same parameters as above);</li>
<li><strong>Mapping</strong> the current fishing and aquaculture system, in terms if <strong>strengths and weaknesses</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Sketching the inertial future scenario</strong> of the fishing and aquaculture sector in Romania, meaning the likely scenario for 2035 in the absence of corrective policy interventions;</li>
<li><strong>Identifying future opportunities</strong> that would allow the system to progress towards more desirable scenarios than the inertial scenario;</li>
<li><strong>Collaboratively developing normative scenarios</strong>, capitalizing on selected opportunities;</li>
<li>Based on the normative scenarios, extracting the<strong> main pillars of a future vision for 2035</strong>;</li>

Mission Boards were appointed to elaborate visions for the future in five Areas: Adaptation to Climate Change, Including Societal Transformation; Cancer; Healthy Oceans, Seas, and Coastal and Inland Waters; Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities; Soil Health and Food. Starting in autumn 2019, five Foresight on Demand projects supported them with foresight expertise and methodology. This project provides the work in support of the Mission Board on Cancer. In interaction with the Mission Board members and responsible Commission services, the project team scanned trends and drivers for cancer, developed two future health scenarios targeted at fighting cancer and roadmaps of events and milestones in the future of fighting cancer.<br></p>

For this purpose VERA carried out an in-depth stocktaking of RTDI related forward looking activities in Europe and internationally and a thorough review of trends and drivers of long-term change of European RTDI governance. On the base of these insights VERA developed scenarios on the evolution of the European Research Area, assessed the critical issues for the ERA’s future capabilities emerging from these scenarios, explored subsequent strategic options and ultimately generated a set of policy recommendations for responsive and future oriented multi-level, multi-domain RTDI policy strategies.</p>
","<p>VERA was conceptualised as a continuously progressing two-way communication process among ERA actor groups from society, industry, academia and policy across domains, levels and regions. It consisted of setting up a strategic conversation between these stakeholders that evolved through several carefully tailored stages in order to jointly discover shared visions and strategic options around the ERA’s future perspectives towards 2020 and far beyond. VERA has explored the gradual evolution following from current patterns of change – but has also explicitly embraced transformative and disruptive developments with a long-term horizon.<br><br>The VERA project was proposed by a consortium of ten internationally renowned institutes from 9 EU countries involving a team of more than 20 researchers with outstanding expertise both in terms of relevant knowledge and forward looking methodology and excellent contacts with RTDI stakeholders in Europe and the world.</p>

","<p><strong>Imagine a world where young people are not just the leaders of tomorrow, but the co-creators of today. </strong></p>
<p>That's the vision behind the <strong>Foresight for Intergenerational Decision-Making</strong> initiative, a brainchild of the Big Brainstorm project run by the Unlock the Future coalition, under the umbrella of the UN Foundation. The Big Brainstorm is like a global talent show on ideas. Young innovators from every corner of the world come together to brainstorm, design, and launch initiatives to tackle some of the biggest challenges humanity faces. This year, over 2,000 young minds have joined the Big Brainstorm, with nearly half of them proposing initiatives to speed up action towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of these, twenty initiatives were selected, and one of them is the <strong>Foresight for Intergenerational Decision-Making</strong>. The heart of this initiative is a <strong>toolkit designed to run multi-stakeholder Foresight exercises</strong>. Think of it as a DIY kit for the future, helping young people to build meaningful spaces where they can engage with adults, particularly decision-makers and the private sector, to co-create their vision for the future. The initiative is based on the belief that young people have innovative ideas and stories that can help shape the future. By using Foresight tools, they can engage in a process of co-creation, sharing their perspectives and visions for the future with decision-makers, and learning to anticipate both the opportunities and threats behind different scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This summer, the toolkit will be put to the test different locations. It's like a world tour for the future, with young leaders from the United Nations Foundation’s Big Brainstorm leading the charge. The toolkit is being designed with the help of Foresight practitioners who have hands-on experience in intergenerational spaces and field experience in the Majority World.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the forward thinkers behind the initiative have launched a global survey and conduct interviews to understand the fears and hopes of young people.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Want to get involved ? You can </strong><a href=""https://forms.gle/osmz4fLEUqucTaos8"" target=""_blank""><strong>complete the survey here</strong></a><strong>  and have the chance to connect with us at the end of the survey! </strong></p>
<p>The Foresight for Intergenerational Decision-Making initiative is a big step towards a future-focused approach. It aims to provide young people with a toolkit for creating meaningful intergenerational spaces, create a platform for adolescents, young people, and Foresight practitioners to brainstorm together, and showcase examples of good practice that can be replicated across the world. The initiative is open to all young people and their allies who are willing to contribute to its goals and offer fresh insights. <strong>Any youth networks interested in leading the organization of piloting experiences are encouraged to get in touch with the Action Group. </strong></p>
<p>In a nutshell, the Foresight for Intergenerational Decision-Making initiative is all about empowering young people to shape their futures. By giving them the tools and platforms to engage with decision-makers and the private sector, the initiative is nurturing a new generation of changemakers who are ready to tackle the world's most pressing challenges. The future is in our hands, and with the help of this initiative, young people are being given the tools to shape it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So, let's roll up our sleeves and get ready to shape the future together! </strong></p>

<p><em>The future generations movement has been growing for almost thirty years and was given a new lease of life after the 2021 report Our Common Agenda. The UN Secretary General has called for a multilateral system that incorporates long-term thinking.

However, more important is the fact that DRAGON-STAR managed to establish stable collaborations with all the major stakeholders in Europe and China. There is an established collaboration with other EU funded projects, while joint events have been organized with the EU Delegation in China, DG Research, DG Agriculture, and EURAXESS Links China.<br>During the 36 months of the Dragon-Star life, the project team worked and succeeded for establishing a cooperation platform between European and Chinese stakeholders towards enhancing the bilateral cooperation in research and innovation.<br>The project has established a sound cooperation with the permanent EU representation in Beijing and worked together for implementing various activities. Similar cooperation has been established with the EC, Member States, Chinese Organizations and Innovation Agencies.<br>A flagship activity was the organization of a considerable number of promotional activities for H2020, and the establishment of a help-desk (CECO) and the implementation of a national network of Regional Contact Points in China, for promoting the program. At the same time, a database with funding opportunities for European researchers is constantly updated providing support to the Europeans interest in China.<br>Moreover, addressing the need to understand the rapid changes in the Chinese research and innovation landscape and draft a suitable cooperation strategy, DRAGON-STAR performed a foresight scenario study, revealing, four plausible scenarios for the future of the Chinese research &amp; innovation landscape.</p>

Democracy in the age of the Anthropocene will necessitate radical shifts in values, power relations and modes of governance, while also being built on the present, in all its diversity, paradox and insufficiency. Innovating to meet these challenges will require re-imagining how people living in democracies become equipped and supported to co-create resilient, democratic futures in Europe and beyond. Clear visions are needed to build strategies that allow for rethinking and redesigning spaces, institutions, instruments and ways to represent and include people in democratic governance. <em>YouthDecide 2040</em> aims to support European Union democracy to rise to these challenges through evidence-based historical and contemporary knowledge, strategic foresight, and robust deliberation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, <em>YouthDecide 2040</em> has the main objective to: co-create with European youth – and older generations, political and institutional actors, and organised civil society – coherent pathways to desired futures of democracy in the European Union in 2040. We translate our main objective into a series of research questions that need to be answered to support the work. Each question is connected to a key objective and corresponding work packages to support co-creation. All activities are planned to be inclusive and open processes – transparently documented along the way – to enable repetition and implementation beyond the life of the project. The project’s ambition is to reinvigorate democracy in and across Europe with visions and pathways – made with active and inclusive citizen participation – for becoming more resilient to current and future challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preferred scenarios, and visions from <em>YouthDecide 2040</em> will aim to inform research and innovation pathways. They will help ensure the alignment of future and ongoing research and innovation with the values and needs of the democratic societies within the EU that support their advancement. The YouthDecide 2040 consortium comprises 11 partners with research expertise in areas of democracy research, foresight, participatory deliberation, co-creation, strategy development, as well as partners working in youth representation and organization, democracy advocacy, design, and multimedia communication. The project duration is three years, until the end of 2027 and it has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 101177438.&nbsp;</p>

Throughout the project, mixed teams of UAIC researchers and company specialists worked together to create an “ecosystem” that met the needs of the market.<br>The PrivateSky platform was used by partner companies for industrial research and experimental development of products and services. This allowed them to launch innovative products in new markets or to convert and integrate on-premise applications with cloud applications.<br>Also, the source code for PrivateSky was licensed in open-source mode, offering open access to the innovative technologies developed by the project to other interested companies.</p>
<p>Among the results obtained, we highlight the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of technology transfer to small and medium-sized enterprises: eight subsidiary contracts were concluded for Type C activities (Research Services) and nine subsidiary contracts for Type D activities (effective collaboration through industrial research and experimental development).</li>
<li>Establishment and final accreditation of the <a href=""https://itransfer.uaic.ro/"" target=""_blank"">iTransfer Technology Transfer Center (TTC-iT)</a> , a financially autonomous research, innovation, and technology transfer infrastructure.</li>
<li>Publication of <a href=""https://projects.info.uaic.ro/private-sky/En/results/index.html"" target=""_blank"">more than 20 scientific papers</a>, some of which were authored by mixed teams composed of company and university researchers.</li>
<li>Submission of<a href=""https://projects.info.uaic.ro/private-sky/En/results/index.html"" target=""_blank""> nine patent applications</a>, each corresponding to the specific innovation developed in collaboration with one of the companies involved in the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project was funded by the Competitiveness Operational Program (POC), Priority Axis 1 – Research, Technological Development and Innovation (RDI) to support economic competitiveness and business development, Action 1.2.3: Knowledge transfer partnerships.<br>The implementation period of the project was 60 months, from 01.09.2016 to 31.08.2021.</p>

<p>Our mission<br>Our mission is to support the involvement of the Czech Republic in the European Research Area (ERA), to process complex strategic studies for research and innovation and transfer research results to decision-making institutions to improve the quality of their strategic decision-making at the national, regional and European levels, carry out international technology transfer and contribute to increasing the international competitiveness of Czech companies.<br><br>Our history<br>Technology Centre Prague (TC) was established in 1994 as an association of legal entities under the name Technology Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. The founding members were the Academy of Sciences - Institute of Chemical Processes, Institute of Physics, Institute of Plasma Physics, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Institute of Microbiology, in 2005 the company Technology Management,Ltd. became a member of the association.<br>The intention to establish the TC had the ideological support of the leadership of the Academy of Sciences at that time, but under conditions the organisation would not draw funds from its central budget. Over time, it became clear that this seemingly negative condition had a fundamentally positive effect on the development and character of the resulting Technology Centre. The permanent need to compete for funds from a wide portfolio of financial sources, including commercial ones, helped to create a very healthy institutional culture for the TC with a clear focus on performance and efficiency.<br>The initial aim of the TC was to operate an incubator for spin-off companies with linked to research projects of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. However, the original generous demarcation of the premises for the incubator was corrected over time, as the Academy of Sciences needed space for its own research. It was clear that the road to the TC's economic self-sufficiency does not lead here, and it was therefore necessary to look for <br>One of these opportunities was the gradual expansion of the portfolio of services for technology-oriented small companies and the strengthening of the technology and knowledge transfer from the research sphere to industry and directly between innovative enterprises. Over time, this activity has become one of the TC's strongest agendas and is currently implemented through the international Enterprise Europe Network, whose activities in the Czech Republic are coordinated by the Technology Centre. The basic aim of the network is to support the growth of the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises and to facilitate their successful entry into international markets.<br>Another such opportunity was the opening of the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development in 1997, even for candidate countries for EU membership. The TC took full advantage of this opportunity and gradually became a respected national information, consultation and training centre that provides comprehensive support for the successful participation of national teams in international research cooperation projects. An extension of this activity was the opening of the Czech Liaison Office for Research, Development and Innovation in Brussels (CZELO) in 2005. The office ensured direct contact between Czech research and European institutions, especially the European Commission and the European Parliament. In 2020, the agenda of the CZELO office was expanded to include the field of education, and its further activities are provided by the House of Foreign Cooperation, a contributory organisation of the Ministry of Education and Culture.<br>An important milestone in the development of the TC was the establishment of the agenda for the preparation of analytical and conceptual studies in the field of research and innovation in 2000. Over time, the TC has become a leading national research workplace and think-tank for the management and policy of research, development, and innovation. The TC provides independent information based on comprehensive evaluations of the research, development, and innovation environment as well as on specialised scientometric analyses. An important element is also the development and application of new approaches for the systematic exploration of variants of the future development of society (foresight) and for the assessment of the impact of new technologies on society (technology assessment). These approaches significantly enrich the outputs of evaluations and system analyses and effectively supplement the portfolio of strategic intelligence services for research and innovation provided by the TC, with the aim of improving the quality of strategic decision-making at the national, regional, and European level.<br>Receiving support for the reconstruction of its own building in 2009 enabled the concentration of all the TC agendas in one place and the construction of a modern conference centre for holding professional seminars, trainings, and conferences. This has created a unique centre of integrated innovation services that synergistically support each other.<br><br>In 2015, the TC expanded its advanced technology initiatives by signing a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to transfer knowledge and technology from ESA space programmes to application areas outside the space sector and to support the development of companies developing or using space technologies. In this context, the TC has also strengthened the activities of its internal acceleration program BusinessRunway, which focuses mainly on companies dealing with space technologies.<br><br>At the end of 2022, the Technology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences was renamed the Technology Centre Prague, and at the beginning of 2023, a memorandum of cooperation was signed with the Czech Academy of Sciences.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br></p>

<p><br><strong>Process &amp; Methodology</strong></p>
<p>The project was structured into three main phases: Research, Crowdsourcing, Storytelling.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the research phase, a PESTLE analysis and the elaboration of local stakeholder maps identified environmental key factors and networks.</li>
<li>In the crowdsourcing phase, participatory workshops with local stakeholders and a Delphi survey with tourism experts were run in parallel, built upon and at the same time challenging the knowledge gathered in the previous phase.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the Storytelling phase, the results were used as the fundament for building six future scenarios, visualised as a written narrative accompanied by an illustration.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
","<p></p>
","<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Building up and strengthening local stakeholder networks and generating ideas for future sustainable tourism(s). Gathering of key insights on desirable, possible and likely future developments of tourism in Spain.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Identification and discussion of needs, desires, worries and attitudes of tourism stakeholders – in its complexity and diversity.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Six future scenarios to inspire can activate communities, organisations and citizens to define measures that accelerate the transformation towards a better, more sustainable tourism. <br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developing indicators to measure the performance of (future) touristic activities in terms of their sustainability. <br></li>
<li>Creating a network of change agents within the tourism sector to exchange experiences, needs, knowledge and to collectively identify possible synergies and action steps to be taken. <br></li>
<li>Designing experimental pilot projects focusing on solving some of the concrete challenges identified as common to one or all of the regions observed.</li>

Together they shape economies, societies and our lifestyle. In both developed and emerging economies, the slowdown in growth, the increasing inequalities and the deepening fractures in the social contract are creating upheavals and instability. However, it is perhaps the right time to mobilise all the new means available to humanity. Empowering and unleashing human capabilities could help face the challenges ahead and create a new socio-economic system that provides trust and opportunities for all.</p>

","<p>A Scientific Committee has identified different aspects to be addressed during meetings that engage the participants to access the state of the art, and discuss them. The ultimate goal of VDC is to involve the local community in becoming more informed and active in shaping the future, which is often regarded as distant from the territorial contexts, and which constitutes the basis of the foresight exercises. The Scientific Committee consists of a selection of the experts who coordinated the Science and Technology Foresight Project of the National Research Council. The involved scientists are a representation of high-level national and international communities.<br><br>Students and teachers from some high schools are involved in advance, in order to brief and prepare questions during the meetings. On scheduled Fridays, the Sala Consigliare of the municipality hosts approximately 100 citizens. Students open the debate with lectures identified the week before, then a moderator initiates a debate with the scientists to elaborate the main concepts and challenges on the selected topics. Open questions from the audience conclude the dialogue, which includes the local public authorities that are invited.

The discussion concerning the development of FP10 revolve around the need to either incrementally refine its existing structure, or to fundamentally transform the framework programme structure in order to make a more impactful FP. Advocates for a major overhaul argue for comprehensive changes to address new global challenges, a declining competitiveness, and the need to align with Europe's strategic goals. On the other hand, proponents of gradual improvement suggest building upon the current system, emphasising continuity and simplification to enhance effectiveness without causing significant disruption. The goal of this study is to develop and assess high-level designs for the EU’s next FP (Hypothetical Programme Structures, HPS), considering the identified geo-political, societal, and economic challenges as well as expected impacts of major technological developments.<br></p>
<p><strong>Study approach </strong><br>The study undertakes a forward-looking analysis, based on alternative scenarios for Europe and its R&amp;I landscape and exploring the structural adaptations that may be required to ensure the programme remains responsive, effective, and aligned with the EU’s strategic priorities. The figure below provides an overview of the key components of the foresight process.</p>
","<p>A key component of the methodology is the series of three foresight workshops with more than 35 stakeholders representing EU R&amp;I stakeholders (university networks, RTOs, private sector companies, NCPs, policymakers, civil society representatives etc.). During the workshops, the participants discussed the main challenges of the FP and identified solutions. Moreover, they made use of the future scenarios developed by the study team, to reflect upon potential implications societal, economic, and environmental trends these scenarios might have on the focus and structure of FP10. Based on this input and an analysis of relevant reports (e.g. FP evaluations and studies, high level reports from Draghi, Letta, Heitor and Niinistö, stakeholder position papers, case studies on selected national R&amp;I programmes) pros and cons of both the evolutionary and disruptive approaches in selected scenarios and their impact on the EU’s R&amp;I landscape and FP structure were formulated. <br>The study presents a set of hypothetical programme structures (HPS) that meet the different scenario settings. Each HPS “tells a different story” about the objectives and means of intervening in the EU R&amp;I landscape. In the context of this study, we understand the HPS as a narrative description as comprising two main elements:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The overarching objectives of the programme</strong> – defining its fundamental purpose and strategic intent.</li>
<li><strong>The main components of the programme</strong> – outlining the broad pillars or themes that guide research investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the workshop discussions, available policy reports and examples of different programme structures at national level, a range of policy options were developed. Policy options include suggestions spanning from the management of the FP to prioritisation and thematical focus, instrument design, improved coordination within the FP, or governance mechanisms to ensure that the FP remains effective under different conditions.<br></p>
","<p></p>
","<p></p>
","<p>This report aims to assist policymakers in reflecting on priority setting and policy development, with the aim of ensuring a relevant and effective R&amp;I programme for the EU’s future. As Europe stands at the crossroads of global competition and unprecedented challenges, FP10 has the potential to become a beacon of excellence and resilience. The challenge now lies in translating EU’s agenda into a coherent, actionable, and politically feasible programme architecture for the FP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has been for nearly 10 years a project-Researcher at the Finland Futures Research Centre, university of Turku. He has worked on numerous challinging research projects.  His work has covered topics of crisis and resilience, ethical approaches to futures, future generations and foresight, anticipatory governance, future imaginaries, and facilitating strategic foresight. He specialises in developing highly participatory and creative approaches to explore open alternative futures. He has taught and lectured on strategic foresight, scenario building, causal layered analysis and Delphi as well as media culture related subjects. He has a multidisciplinary background with two master's degrees in Futures Studies from the Turku School of Economics, University of Turku and in Audiovisual Media Culture from the University of Lapland; which build on his previous undergraduate studies in design from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, London.</p>
<p>Understanding future opportunities and strategic pathways is a common goal for organisations and institutions alike. Using a structured foresight process, creating for example scenarios and futures workshops that help large corporations, high-performing SMEs, associations and public institutions manage disruptive change and shape their future with foresight. This is intellectually stimulating, and combines analytical rigour with creative vision. On the other hand experiencing the future needs to be done in novel creative ways, and engaging critical uncertanties provides essential discussion and opens key questions. <br><br>As a researcher I have been lucky to learn from a dynamic team with the goal of pushing the development of futures research. Typically to analyse trends, identify key uncertainties of the future, explore scenarios in a participatory way and destil recommendations for action to form strategic paths into the future.

Social innovation plays a pivotal role in transforming today’s food systems into ones that are economically and socially feasible, and sustainable within planetary boundaries. <br><br>The project <em>Reimagining the Food System: scanning the horizon for emerging social innovations </em>was conducted by the Foresight on Demand consortium between July - December 2021, on behalf of the European Environment Agency. It engaged in a systemic examination of emerging social innovations across the food chain, conducted using horizon scanning, a tool to detect early signs of potentially important developments. Thus, it offers insights into the experimentation taking place in alternative ways to produce, trade and consume food.<br><br>Project phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The horizon-scanning combined web mining with a filtering and validation process, using machine learning and human evaluation. The exercise identified over 240 weak (or early) signals from a variety of news articles, blogs and grey literature published in English between 2017 and 2021. The signals were aggregated into 24 closely related subsets, with each cluster hinting at a potential emerging issue (see image below);</li>
</ul>
","<ul>
<li>Next, 21 representatives from civil society organisations, business, academia and government discussed these issues at a sense-making workshop in September 2021;</li>
<li>Following the workshop, 10 emerging issues were prioritised for characterisation. The characterisation was based on desk research and 11 semi-structured interviews with experts in the field. The 10 selected emerging issues include developments in new foods, products, services, and business and governance models. These issues have often been enabled by existing technologies and new forms of local partnerships, involving a variety of engaged stakeholders. They vary in their degree of maturity and novelty: some are relatively new developments, while others lend new perspectives to known subjects. Moreover, some provide new combinations of existing elements, while others are niche practices beginning to filter into the mainstream:<br><br>1. Agroecology: a way of producing food and living, a science and a movement for change<br>2. Soulful soil: alternative methods for nutrient and pest management<br>3. The power of many: community-supported agriculture networks and initiatives<br>4. Food-growing cities: urban farming, integrated food policies and citizen involvement<br>5. Muscle-up: alternative protein sources for human consumption<br>6. Knowledge is power: ensuring traceability and informing consumers<br>7. Reclaiming retail: (re)connecting farmers with consumers and businesses<br>8. Procurement strategies supporting sustainable agricultural and fishing practices<br>9. Menu for change: restaurants feed appetite for sustainability<br>10. The gift that keeps on giving: upcycled foods and food into energy</li>

Considering that, a debate is warranted to shift the attention from human performance to a more inclusive performance of flourishing ecosystems. <br>In this context, the vision of the project “<em>S&amp;T&amp;I FOR 2050. Science, Technology and Innovation for Ecosystem Performance – Accelerating Sustainability Transitions</em>” was driven by <strong>the desire for STI efforts to place ecosystem performance on par with human performance.</strong> This broadens the focus of STI to <strong>encompass multiple conceptualisations of human-nature relations and to contribute to sustainability transitions</strong>.<br><br>The project’s overarching goal was to <strong>identify and map future scientific and technological developments, which can radically improve ecosystem performance</strong>. In doing so, it provided reflections on the 2nd strategic plan of Horizon Europe (HE), in its broad direction to support the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>The study was conducted along several phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on literature review, the project team developed <strong>three perspectives on future relations between humans and nature and humans’ role in the flourishing of planetary ecosystems</strong>. The three perspectives are: i) protecting and restoring ecosystems, ii) co-shaping socio-ecological systems, and iii) caring within hybrid collectives</li>
<li><strong>A two-round Dynamic Argumentative Delphi (DAD) online survey</strong> explored the most dynamic scientific and technological developments. The survey engaged over 600 experts globally in enriching, assessing and prioritizing STI directions in terms of their potential to contribute to the capability of planetary ecosystems to flourish from now to 2050.</li>
<li>Drawing in on the three perspectives and the results of the DAD survey, <strong>six case studies on core sustainability issues explored the three perspectives</strong>. Reflections on implications for R&amp;I policies in the context of the European Green Deal conclude each of the six case studies:  i) Law for Nature; ii) Land Use Futures; iii) Soil to Soul; iv) Accelerating transitions to regenerative economy; v) Ecosystems and Micro-and Nano Cosmos; vi) Data as Representation</li>

<p><strong>Everybody is looking into the Future! A literature review of reports on emerging technologies and disruptive innovation </strong></p>
<p>Growing volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, present leading challenges in policy-making nowadays. Anticipatory thinking and foresight are of utmost importance to help explore trends, risks, emerging issues, and their potential implications and opportunities in order to draw useful insights for strategic planning, policy-making and preparedness. The findings include a set of 106 signals and trends on emerging technologies and disruptive innovations across several areas of application based on a review of key reports on technology and innovation trends and signals produced by public and private entities outside of the EU institutions. Its goal is to strengthen the EIC’s strategic intelligence capacity through the use and development of anticipatory approaches that will - among other goals – support innovation funding prioritisation. Other insights were extracted, namely those related with the scope of the EIC Programme Manager portfolios.&nbsp;</p>

","<p><strong>Scanning deep tech horizons: Participatory collection and assessment of signals and trends </strong></p>
<p>The Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Innovation Council (EIC) conducted a series of Horizon Scanning exercises across six EIC programme managers’ (PM) portfolios as part of an ongoing collaborative effort to strengthen EIC strategic intelligence capacity through the use and development of anticipatory approaches. The fields covered include: Space Systems &amp; Technologies; Quantum Technologies; Agriculture &amp; Food; Solar Fuels &amp; Chemicals; Responsible Electronics and Architecture, Engineering &amp; Construction. The main findings of this Horizon Scanning – the identification and analysis of ‘signals’ from nascent research, technologies, or trends on the periphery of the mainstream – show opportunities for investment in emerging technologies and breakthrough innovations that can advance EU competitiveness while also serving to support the EU’s long-term policy and societal visions.Other insights were taken from this exercise, namely the identification of drivers, enablers and barriers to technology development and adoption, that could be the starting ground of further foresight exercises and policy initiatives. The report highlights three main themes – sustainability, energy, and scalability, which are overarching across signals, drivers, enablers and barriers. And concludes with a series of recommendations to streamline Horizon Scanning activities in the specific context and needs of the EIC.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Technology Foresight for Public Funding of Innovation: Methods and Best Practices</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;In times of growing uncertainties and complexities, anticipatory thinking is essential for policymakers<strong>. </strong>Technology foresight explores the longer-term futures of Science, Technology and Innovation. It can be used as a tool to create effective policy responses, including in technology and innovation policies, and to shape technological change. In this report we present six anticipatory and technology foresight methods that can contribute to anticipatory intelligence in terms of public funding of innovation: the Delphi survey, genius forecasting, technology roadmapping, large language models used in foresight, horizon scanning and scenario planning. Each chapter provides a brief overview of the method with case studies and recommendations.The insights from this report show that only by combining different anticipatory viewpoints and approaches to spotting, understanding and shaping emergent technologies, can public funders such as the European Innovation Council improve their proactive approaches to supporting ground-breaking technologies. In this way, they will help innovation ecosystems to develop.&nbsp;</p>

","<p>The secondary research conducted, initially revealed about twenty megatrends and trends, often cited in published academic papers, foresight books, reputable strategic studies, in the media, and especially in The Megatrends Hub of the JRC . Seven of these Megatrends, with a significant impact on the European and global economy, society and policies, have been selected.</p>
<p>Many of the megatrends presented here, are found in the European Commission’s Megatrends Hub or other sources of recognised standing in procedures of Horizon Scanning. In addition, the simple method of the Futures Wheel, which can be used by public institutions as a first step in understanding the interconnection of upcoming changes and challenges, is set out in Annex I (Glenn, 2009) .&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analysis identified global challenges such as climate change, potential financial crises, pandemics and implications of exponential technological developments. These challenges (eg.Covid19) -often not directly dependent on the human factor- will bring about extensive pressure and significant impact on countries and societies. The effects of climate change and environmental degradation are likely to affect food and water availability for poor countries, intensify migration, cause new health challenges and contribute to biodiversity loss. New technologies will emerge and will spread faster, disrupting the economy, the labour market, society itself and the citizen’s position in it. The continuing effects of climate change exacerbate inequalities and intensify the phenomenon of climate migration globally, creating constantly new problems in both the countries of origin and of destination.

For this purpose, normative future scenarios were created from which inspiring future job profiles could be derived. In a final step, recommendations identify options for action through which the envisioned future can be approximated.</p>
","<p>The results are based on a three-stage methodology approach:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>First, key thematic areas were outlined through baseline research and expert interviews.</li>
<li>Second, a foresight workshop was conducted to create a room to elaborate on different future scenarios and job profiles while also developing a digital skills map and initially discuss recommendations.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Third, the results were refined through expert validation loops and expert interviews.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong><em>future scenarios </em></strong>were created to explore what urban areas, smaller cities and rural areas might look like in 2035. A future is drawn in which Tunisia is characterized by smart and self-powered buildings, increasing e-mobility, and public services delivered digitally. Apart from that, digital progress offers the opportunity to provide more equitable education, to conduct various types of commercial activities via e-commerce, and to improve access to health. Such a future in its variety of facets has been visually depicted in the graphic above.</p>
<p><br>Furthermore, <strong><em>future job profiles</em></strong> are derived on this basis. In a desirable Tunisian development, these will be found primarily in the areas of food production, fintech, e-commerce, health tech, mobility, ed-, gov-, and green tech. Specific job profiles range from farm drone operators, who operate and maintain drones that monitor, measure and analyze crop growth and health, to cybersecurity experts, who protect government data from digital attacks. To be prepared for the changing profiles, digital competencies need to be developed, which can be categorized into the following four pillars: digital literacy and data literacy, technology-specific skills, digital product literacy, and digital transformation literacy.</p>
<p><br>After developing future scenarios and outlining future job profiles, <strong><em>recommendations</em></strong> were finally drawn up that will enable Tunisia to proactively strive for the future outlined. General recommendations manifest themselves, for example, in the promotion of a ""digital culture"" that includes all strata of the population in order to make appropriate use of the potential of digitization. A specific example of a topic area recommendation is to strive for leadership in green tech solutions. Here, it is recommended to promote green tech culture, for example by including environmental sustainability and green tech solutions in education and public campaigns. In addition to content recommendations, Foresight Journey recommendations aim to improve and deepen the methodological applications of foresight for potential future ventures in this thematic field.</p>
<p><br><em>Smart Futures Tunisia is part of the Special Initiative “Decent Work for a Just Transition” Invest for Jobs of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and implemented by the Digital Transformation Programme Tunisia of the Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH. Invest for Jobs aims to team up with companies to create good jobs in eight African partner countries and to improve local working conditions.</em></p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>Already in 2016, the need for a rapid response foresight facility was identified by the SFRI expert group (Strategic Foresight for R&amp;I Policy in Horizon 2020). They emphasized the importance of integrating foresight into European policymaking and complementing long-term strategic foresight with a rapid response mechanism. This would equip the European Commission with the necessary intelligence to swiftly address unexpected developments. In the context of R&amp;I policy, greater flexibility in using foresight is essential to support various policy initiatives, from framework programmes to European partnerships. Higher and longer-term R&amp;I ambitions, such as those in the context of missions, may require revisiting agendas, priorities, and plans in light of new scientific discoveries and socio-economic or geopolitical developments.<br>Building on the expertise and competence developed during FOD1 (2019-2023), FOD2 (2024-2028) will significantly expand the previous initiative, offering a more comprehensive and adaptable approach to address a broader range of challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Client Authorities</strong><br>The demand for Foresight on Demand affects various European Commission services and other European institutions and agencies involved in policymaking at EU level. Foresight is increasingly important for implementing R&amp;I policies, as large-scale initiatives and ambitious long-term projects require more than traditional strategic planning. They profit from a long-term view on emerging research opportunities and innovation needs. Joint Technology Initiatives and other European partnerships, which pursue long-term agendas, can build on foresight knowledge to anticipate and respond to emerging scientific, technological and socio-economic developments.<br>Several client authorities, including the European Commission (lead), EEA, ERCEA, FRA, ETF, EUROFUND, EFSA, EMCDDA, ECDC, EISMEA, EASA, OSHA, Global Health EDCTP3, and the Joint Undertakings EU-RAIL and CBE JU, have entered a single framework contract (FWC) for Foresight on Demand. While foresight processes are increasingly integrated into policymaking, the timing requirements for foresight intelligence and sense-making (e.g. signals of change in society, economy, science, and technology) often necessitate a quicker response than what usual foresight activities can provide. THE FOD framework provides the setting and conditions for this rapid foresight response mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>FOD Consortium</strong><br>The FOD consortium comprises fifteen core partners and five specialised partners, totalling twenty research and technology organisations experienced in foresight. Fourteen of the core partners were also involved in the first period of FOD (2019-2023), while seven new partners joined for the current FOD2 period (2024-2028). The new partners include 4CF The Foresight Company, DLR, TIS, EUNOMIA, RAND Europe, VTT, and Prognos, with 4CF and RAND Europe joining as core partners. The incumbent core partners are Arctik, Fraunhofer ISI, FFRC, IDEA Consult, Insight Foresight Institute, ISINNOVA, Institutul de Prospectiva, Technopolis, 4strat, Technology Centre Prague, Visionary Analytics, and ZSI Center for Social Innovation. The consortium is led by AIT Austrian Institute of Technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br>The framework contract is the basis for the Foresight on Demand (FOD) mechanism and aims at providing quick forward-looking inputs to policymaking by leveraging the best available foresight knowledge. FOD operates on a much shorter timescale complementarily to longer-term foresight activities but relies on extensive ongoing and accomplished foresight work. Access to a wide range of foresight sources and expertise is crucial for fulfilling FOD functions.<br>Policymakers increasingly face sudden and often surprising events that can quickly escalate secondary policy issues into disruptive ones requiring fast and effective responses. FOD foresight knowledge must be timely and efficient to support decisions related to urgent crises, emerging risks, and opportunities for addressing ongoing policy challenges. FOD aims to offer the broad range of client authorities timely and effective support in uncertain times, and provide forward-looking insights for policy design, planning, and implementation.<br>Foresight benefits policymaking in various ways, including for example by scanning the horizon for emerging developments and weak signals or by developing scenarios of alternative futures to better understand and to be better prepared for disruptive futures. The FOD service steps in where foresight activities have already been initiated or where there is a need to strengthen foresight capabilities, providing targeted foresight services that respond to emerging demands and potentially relevant developments.<br></p>

While foresight processes are increasingly integrated into policymaking, the timing requirements for foresight intelligence and sense-making (e.g. signals of change in society, economy, science, and technology) often necessitate a quicker response than what usual foresight activities can provide. THE FOD framework provides the setting and conditions for this rapid foresight response mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>FOD Consortium</strong><br>The FOD consortium comprises fifteen core partners and five specialised partners, totalling twenty research and technology organisations experienced in foresight. Fourteen of the core partners were also involved in the first period of FOD (2019-2023), while seven new partners joined for the current FOD2 period (2024-2028). The new partners include 4CF The Foresight Company, DLR, TIS, EUNOMIA, RAND Europe, VTT, and Prognos, with 4CF and RAND Europe joining as core partners. The incumbent core partners are Arctik, Fraunhofer ISI, FFRC, IDEA Consult, Insight Foresight Institute, ISINNOVA, Institutul de Prospectiva, Technopolis, 4strat, Technology Centre Prague, Visionary Analytics, and ZSI Center for Social Innovation. The consortium is led by AIT Austrian Institute of Technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br>The framework contract is the basis for the Foresight on Demand (FOD) mechanism and aims at providing quick forward-looking inputs to policymaking by leveraging the best available foresight knowledge. FOD operates on a much shorter timescale complementarily to longer-term foresight activities but relies on extensive ongoing and accomplished foresight work. Access to a wide range of foresight sources and expertise is crucial for fulfilling FOD functions.<br>Policymakers increasingly face sudden and often surprising events that can quickly escalate secondary policy issues into disruptive ones requiring fast and effective responses. FOD foresight knowledge must be timely and efficient to support decisions related to urgent crises, emerging risks, and opportunities for addressing ongoing policy challenges. FOD aims to offer the broad range of client authorities timely and effective support in uncertain times, and provide forward-looking insights for policy design, planning, and implementation.<br>Foresight benefits policymaking in various ways, including for example by scanning the horizon for emerging developments and weak signals or by developing scenarios of alternative futures to better understand and to be better prepared for disruptive futures. The FOD service steps in where foresight activities have already been initiated or where there is a need to strengthen foresight capabilities, providing targeted foresight services that respond to emerging demands and potentially relevant developments.<br></p>

This has raised concerns over the ensuing social, economic and environmental trends and related impact on the way supply chains are organised. In this context, the <strong>EU-funded ReSChape project</strong> will analyse social, economic and environmental changes and disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluate their impact on supply chains. New supply chain models will be proposed, aiming towards a more streamlined supply chain process to assure humans (workers, consumers and in general citizens) to be at the center of the business also thanks to new digital technologies. It will be studied how to <strong>assure a positive social impact</strong> and innovative policy scenarios will be developed with recommendations to support the future supply chains.</p>
","<p>The aims of this proposal are:<br>• To analyse social, economic and environmental changes and disruptions (including covid) and evaluate their impact on SCs, identifying related challenges in terms of relationship between countries, configuration of the network, impact on employment.</p>
<p><br>• To study and propose a set of SC models for the evolution of global SC integrating strategies like resource efficient, closed-loop and humanitarian as a way to increase EU resilience and sustainability. Particular attention will be given to the role of digitalization as a way to establish new paths for social inclusion taking into consideration the needs of urban and rural areas. Some important European sectors like fashion, automotive, medical and machine tools will be analysed with case studies and survey.</p>
<p><br>• To develop Innovative tools for monitoring and assessing sectoral trade patterns and defining mechanisms to evaluate relationship of disruptions like pandemic and global value chains taking into consideration impact on employment, economic growth, incomes etc also in the long term. Moreover, it will be analysed the impact of different trade patterns, on the EU value added of sectoral and countries with a specific focus on analyzing income inequalities and proposition of decent work and social cohesion. Particular attention will be gives to gender issues and social disparities.</p>
<p><br>• To develop innovative policy scenarios with recommendations for future global value chains: policy scenarios will be based on Key horizontal issues impacting on several sectors and will provide recommendations for EU, national and sectoral strategies, policy measures and targeted actions aimed at shaping fair, inclusive and sustainable trade patterns, value and supply chains as well as production networks.</p>

My name is Matt. My core area of research is in Futures and Foresight Science. This area of research investigates planning tools such as scenario analysis, horizon scanning, innovation forecasting, technology roadmapping, systems modelling, structural analysis, Delphi studies, prediction markets, trend auditing, cross-impact analysis, morphological analysis, stress-testing and wind-tunnelling, and intelligence dashboards. These tools all have underpinning assumptions and produce different futures in the present. We can come to know these tools and improve upon them as we observe their application in practice. STS, or the Sociology of Science and Technology, provides the lens from which inquiry is conducted on these tools and the groups that use them.<br><br>These tools are useful for producing answers to the question: “What is the future of X?” Where “X” can be just about anything of interest: From organizations to technologies, sectors, or social movements. Tool application to various topics and areas of concern are in high demand from private organizations to policy makers, and I often consult and facilitate with clients and in projects that leverages my knowledge of the foresight toolbox in research project modules to help groups generate knowledge and insights about the futures they are interested in.  <br><br>My second area of interest is in innovation, strategy, and policymaking in the maritime and offshore industries. These sectors are investing heavily in technology and developing rapidly. They are also among the most difficult to decarbonize and electrify. I’ve got a large network of industry contacts from this sector with whom I collaborate with on research projects and student projects.<br><br>I serve on the editorial board at Futures and Foresight Science and curate a Youtube playlist, “Futures and Foresight Papers Explained” and a playlist on maritime innovation, ""Sustainable Blue Growth.""</p>

Throughout the process, participants focused on four future critical technologies that deserve particular attention: (i) quantum communications and cryptography; (ii) space platform; (iii) integrated photonics; and (iv) nuclear micro-reactors. These future critical technologies bear a high level of impact and a high probability of future EU dependency on others. For each one, the report includes a series of recommendations to address risks, challenges and future dependencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the listing and analysis of key technologies, the authors summarised 10 clusters of topics related to technology development and adoption: (i) geopolitics; (ii) cooperation; (iii) investment; (iv) market; (v) skills and knowledge; (vi) ethical issues; (vii) regulations and standards; (viii) development of technology building blocks; (ix) twin transition and security of assets; and (x) data and communications.These insights can support further research and policy developments. The report concludes with a detailed explanation of the methodology applied and the results of intermediary phases.</p>

Abductive Heuristics (AH) are concepts to keep in mind when looking at a complex system, organization, or situation. Skilled navigators, policymakers, and business executives (should) use heuristics where there's no model, inadequate data, too much data, or where key factors are effectively invisible to the standard way of managing a situation.Experience helps. The objective of the AH toolkit is to condense experience and knowledge from studying complex adaptive systems, chaotic human behavior, and more than human ecologies and evolutions into useful means for facilitators including foresight practitioners.</p>

The project explores reference scenarios for fundamental rights and considers how different drivers of change could impact on fundamental rights in the period up until 2040. The scenarios will form the basis for a set of foresight policy briefs for selected megatrends. The project builds on the <a href=""https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC132943"" target=""_blank"">reference foresight scenarios</a>  developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, with a view to complement them with fundamental rights considerations. <br><br>The project includes horizon scanning, retrofitting scenarios, visioning, developing future pathways and policy options stress-testing. In all the activities, the project utilizes FRA’s draft guidance on inclusive, non-discriminatory and participatory foresight. Outputs comprise of a set of fundamental rights scenarios, foresight policy briefs and a guidance on embedding fundamental rights into foresight.  <br><br>This project and the foresight knowledge it generates will enable FRA and other stakeholders to support EU institutions and Member States in addressing future challenges by creating a foresight framework that incorporates a fundamental rights perspective and ensures that policies remain inclusive, forward-looking and in line with the EU's core values.<br></p>

Its Consumer Observatory  is Europe’s central hub for current and future consumer insights on agrifood topics. The observatory has identified general and consumer-specific trends and other driving forces, which were used as a starting point for this scenario work. During the summer and autumn 2024, Insight Foresight Institute organised online workshops to develop four alternative future scenarios and their implications to stakeholders. <br></p>
<p>Scenarios are not predictions of the likely future, but they depict possible futures. Exploring alternative scenarios helps to expand one’s own span of observation further towards the future, and to possible threats and opportunities that otherwise might not be in the immediate attention span, or just being excluded for being unlikely. While the scenarios often consist of a possible future state and the pathway from the present to that future, in this case, our narratives of the future (written in the present tense, as if we were already in the future) describe each a different day in 2035. <br></p>
<p>The work focuses on the futures of food consumption and the agrifood ecosystem in 2035 in Europe, specifically with regards to emerging technological opportunities for new products and retail experiences as well as to (un)sustainable and (un)healthy consumer choices. These dimensions provided a structure that ensured that each of the four scenarios was truly different: <br>•	Scenario A: GREEN AND ME - A Day in European High-Tech Food Ecosystem in 2035<br>•	Scenario B: FRUGAL AND LOCAL - A Day in European Localized Food Sector Driven by Community Values in 2035 <br>•	Scenario C: COST AND CONTROL - A Day in European Decayed Food Ecosystem Focused on Industrial Efficiency in 2035<br>•	Scenario D: HIGHS AND LOWS - A Day in European Unequal High-Tech Food Ecosystem in 2035. <br>We conclude the paper by reflecting on the scenarios and their implications to decision-makers today.<br></p>
<p></p>
","<p></p>
","<p></p>
","<p></p>
","<p>Implications <br>Further reflection on the implications of four scenarios to food consumption and the ecosystem led us to formulate the following issues potentially relevant for today´s decision-makers. The identified implications are not priorities and they are not ranked in any particular order. They are meant to be potential openings for further reflection on future developments in the sector. <br><br>1.	Guiding Consumers Towards One-Health Choices<br>The food sector plays a critical role in guiding consumers to make well-informed one-health choices that benefit human health, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability. To achieve this, the sector must enhance value chain information sharing, providing transparency about how food is produced, processed, and distributed. Implementing Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) for new production methods—such as urban farming, indoor aquaculture, and cellular meat—is essential to evaluate their true environmental impacts and determine if they can sustainably scale to feed the global population. <br>Public research and action are vital to prevent greenwashing and corporate monopolisation, ensuring that innovations contribute to sustainability rather than merely serving private interests. The sector must also address the rising costs associated with dietary diseases and navigate the complex regulation of addictive substances in foods, whose misuse can lead to health issues. <br>Three out of four scenarios envision unequal societies, pinpointing that techno-economic innovations are insufficient to attain one health. Social innovations and ensuring food choices, safety and security for all citizens are integral parts of the needed transition. By proactively tackling these challenges, the food sector can promote a more transparent, equitable, and sustainable food system that empowers consumers to make choices aligned with one-health principles.<br><br>2.	Embracing Innovative (New and Ancient) Mood-related Food Ingredients <br>As consumer preferences shift towards wellness and unique experiences, there is a rising demand for novel food ingredients, including technological innovations, ancient ingredients and mood-enhancing properties. As the intersection of nutrition and mental well-being gains prominence, mood-related foods are poised to become a significant segment of the food industry. These foods aim to enhance emotional health, reduce stress, and improve cognitive function through natural ingredients. The future could see a blend of innovative technologies and also a resurgence of ancient ingredients known for their psychotropic or adaptogenic properties. <br>Mood-related foods have the potential to revolutionize the way we approach mental well-being through diet. By addressing regulatory challenges and fostering collaboration among policymakers, businesses, and researchers, we can pave the way for these innovative products to enter the market responsibly. This not only satisfies consumer demand but also promotes a more holistic approach to health that integrates both physical and emotional wellness. By proactively addressing regulatory and market challenges through collaboration among policymakers, businesses, and researchers, we can successfully introduce innovative and ancient ingredients into the food supply, meeting future consumer demands and advancing public health.<br><br>3.	Prioritising Animal Welfare <br>Animal welfare is an increasingly important aspect of sustainability that consumers expect the food sector to take seriously. Integrating the one-health approach—which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health—requires balancing animal welfare with conservation efforts. For example, while sustainable aquaculture practices like closed-cycle systems aim to reduce environmental impact, they may not sufficiently address the well-being of the farmed animals. This oversight can lead to ethical concerns among consumers and potentially harm a company's reputation. Therefore, the food sector must ensure that sustainability initiatives encompass robust animal welfare standards. By doing so, businesses can meet consumer expectations, uphold ethical practices, and contribute to a holistic approach to sustainability that benefits all facets of the ecosystem.<br>For instance, while sustainable aquaculture practices, such as closed-cycle systems, aim to minimize environmental impact and support conservation efforts, they may inadvertently overlook the well-being of farmed aquatic animals. Issues like high stocking densities, poor water quality, and inadequate health management can lead to stress, disease, and suffering among fish and other aquaculture species. This neglect not only raises ethical questions but can also affect product quality and consumer trust. <br><br>4.	Mainstreaming Precision Nutrition<br>The mainstreaming of precision nutrition—customizing dietary recommendations based on individual genetic, microbiome, and metabolic profiles—presents significant implications for the food sector. Advancements in omics and microbiome-related technologies require further research to effectively link them to nutrition, necessitating an integral development of solutions from new ingredient production to personalized data management within regulatory frameworks. Scaling up personalized nutrition demands robust partnerships with technology providers, creating win-win scenarios that foster innovation and efficiency. However, there is a risk of widening inequalities and income disparities, as vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income individuals or those without land access) may struggle to integrate into these advanced systems, impacting food security. Additionally, localized production methods often come with higher costs under current technologies, potentially exacerbating inequality unless technological evolution makes these options more affordable and accessible for all.<br><br>5.	Scaling Up Localized Food Systems<br>Local food systems play a pivotal role in enhancing the diversity and resilience of our food supply while offering substantial benefits to consumers and communities. By focusing on locally sourced production and distribution, these systems foster stronger connections between people and their food, promote sustainable practices, and build robust local economies. Scaling up emerging solutions to enhance diversity and resilience in food systems requires a concerted effort across policy, business, and research sectors.<br>Policymakers could support the development of local producer networks by creating favourable regulations and providing incentives for localized value chains. This could include promoting the use of organic fertilisers to foster circular economies and ensuring food security by encouraging short supply chains that are less vulnerable to global disruptions. Policies could also focus on integrating digital tools for local bartering and distribution systems, enhancing community-based economies without compromising low-tech practices. Additionally, there must be strategies in place to help localized food systems adapt to extreme weather events and resource shortages, especially in the face of weakened global support structures.<br>Businesses have the opportunity to invest in and collaborate with local producers, enhancing economic viability and sustainability. They can leverage digital platforms to improve coordination and distribution within local markets. However, they must also navigate challenges in urban centres where land availability and costs hinder fully localised food systems. Innovative solutions like vertical farming or rooftop gardens could be explored to maximize space efficiency.<br>Researchers could focus on developing strategies that bolster the resilience of localised food systems against environmental and resource-based challenges. This includes studying the impact of extreme weather events on local agriculture and exploring sustainable practices that can be adopted by local producers. Research can also aid in optimising digital tools for community coordination without undermining low-tech methodologies. Furthermore, economic studies are needed to assess the feasibility and scalability of localised food systems in various settings, particularly in densely populated urban areas.<br><br>6.	Embracing Soilless Agriculture<br>Soilless production methods—such as hydroponics, vertical farming, and urban agriculture using indoor LED lighting—are reshaping the food sector by offering alternatives to traditional soil-based farming. These technologies enable efficient food production in urban environments, reducing reliance on arable land and mitigating issues related to soil degradation and water scarcity. By decreasing dependence on precipitation and allowing for controlled growing conditions, soilless systems can enhance food security and provide consistent yields year-round. However, the transition to soilless production presents challenges, including high initial investment costs, energy consumption for lighting and climate control, and the need for technical expertise. The food sector must consider these factors to successfully integrate soilless methods, balancing sustainability with economic viability to meet the demands of a growing global population.<br><br>7.	Empowering Farmers and Prosumer Communities<br>Empowering farmers and prosumer communities has significant implications for the food sector by making farming more attractive and accessible. Instead of focusing solely on high-tech solutions, implementing technologies that reduce the physical hardships of agricultural work can encourage more people to engage in farming. Providing education help individuals to make informed decisions about their involvement in food production. This approach is crucial in regions with low fertility rates, such as the EU, where demographic shifts cannot be easily altered, and reliance on immigration policies is uncertain. By educating consumers and training communities in sustainable practices like regenerative farming, foraging, and marine permaculture, the food sector can motivate people to engage and adopt environmentally friendly practices. This not only enhances food security but also builds resilient communities actively participating in the food system.<br><br>8.	High-Tech Risks<br>The growing reliance on high-tech solutions in the food sector—such as AI-driven production systems, biotech foods, and drone deliveries—introduces significant vulnerabilities that could disrupt the entire food ecosystem. System failures in AI-controlled agriculture could halt production, leading to supply shortages and economic losses. Food safety breaches in biotechnology-produced foods might pose health risks, eroding consumer trust in innovative food products. Similarly, breakdowns in drone delivery networks could impede the distribution of food, particularly in areas that depend heavily on such technology. These scenarios underscore the risks of over-dependence on high-tech. The food sector must therefore implement robust risk management strategies, including backups and fail-safes, to mitigate potential disruptions. Balancing technological advancements with traditional practices can create a more resilient food system that is less susceptible to the pitfalls of technology failures.<br><br>9.	Balancing Global vs. Local Dynamics <br>The interplay between global and local food systems has significant implications for the food sector, particularly in the context of sustainable competition policy. Balancing these dynamics is crucial to maintaining international peace, especially if global trade diminishes. Without equitable global trade, inequalities between developed and developing countries may intensify, as the latter might not have access to advanced technologies yet continue to supply raw materials. This disparity can exacerbate economic imbalances and hinder collaborative efforts towards food security. Limiting the market power of big corporations becomes essential to prevent monopolistic practices and the risk of cartels setting prices, which can undermine both global and local markets. Implementing policies that promote fair competition and technology sharing can help mitigate these risks, ensuring that the benefits of the food sector are distributed more evenly and sustainably across Europe and the world.<br> <br></p>

As climate change continues to impact our world, it becomes crucial to understand and manage its complex effects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Objective(s)</strong><br>CROSSEU aims to respond to increasing societal needs to reduce climate-damaging actions, adapt to the expected consequences, and increase socio-economic resilience. <br><br>The main ambition of the project is to provide a science based and ready to use decision support system built on enhanced understanding of the biogeophysical risks from climate change, and their socioeconomic impacts in Europe, fully co-produced and implemented with practice stakeholders to ensure its uptake, and support effective coping with sectoral and cross sectoral climate risks within the context of the European green transition.<br><br>It will do this by delivering a climate-sensitive framework, including a ready-to-use decision support system platform and technical recommendations, to inform investment decisions, cost-effective adaptation and mitigation options and policy response to climate change. <br><br>The project will contribute to advancing the understanding of the socio-economic risks and response options associated with climate change impact in Europe in different timeframes, including the post-COVID-19 societal-environmental transformation, and derive practical recommendations for political and societal action. <br><br>The solutions proposed are based on an extensive assessment of the socio-economic risks of climate change in a cross-sectoral hierarchical approach, based on storylines addressing key categories of climate hazards in different socio-economic sectors and climate change-sensitive areas across countries and European regions. <br><br>The project will offer a ready-to-use solution that integrates complex information from available climate risk data sets and non-climatic sectoral data collected during the project implementation and derived through modelling based on demand-driven climate-socio-economic pathways. <br><br>CROSSEU is designed to bridge the science-based information about the economic impacts of climate change, and the unique contributions of the project will be: <br><br>         1. the quantification of costs of existent and emergent socio-economic risks and opportunities at NUTS3 level<br>         2. an improved representation of adaptation within biogeophysical climate change risk <br>         3. a better consideration of modelling uncertainties by identifying their nature, assessing their characteristics in a systematic way to determine a better informed and robust decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
","<p>The project's foresight component is crucial for projecting how various climate impacts will unfold under different global pathways (RCP-SSP). By examining future scenarios, it allows decision-makers to anticipate and plan for the most critical challenges, helping societies prepare for the compounded effects of climate change across sectors. The focus on cross-sectoral linkages emphasizes the need for integrated, multi-dimensional strategies to address both immediate and long-term climate risks, while ensuring social equity and resilience.<br>Future scenarios involve identifying and evaluating highly vulnerable areas across Europe in terms of their exposure to climate change, sensitivity to its impacts, and adaptive capacity. It focuses on key sectors—such as biodiversity, health, agriculture, forests, and water—and examines how these areas are likely to experience intense climate changes, particularly extreme events, in the future (2030, 2050, 2100).</p>
<p><strong>Outputs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enhance the modelling of mitigation and adaptation strategies in relation to projected bio-geo-physical processes and socioeconomic risks to different sectors for different time horizons (i.e. 2030, 2050 and 2100) considering both the individual characteristics and interactions between the various sectors</li>
<li>Co-assess synergies conflicts and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation strategies across different sectors regions</li>
<li>Co-produce ready to use tools integrated in a science based decision support system for assessing the social and economic impacts of climate change, and support mitigation and adaptation options towards a climate resilient Europe</li>
<li>Consolidate the European union's response to climate change challenges and social and economic impacts in the context of the transformation related to the post COVID-19 crisis and geopolitical challenges</li>
</ul>
<p><br><strong>Expected outcomes</strong><br>1. The project delivers a science based and ready to use decision support system built on enhanced understanding of the biogeophysical risks from climate change, and their socioeconomic impacts in Europe, fully co-produced and implemented with practice stakeholders to ensure its uptake.<br>2. The project consistently contributes to enhancing the overall impact of the destination climate across the EU <br>3. The project facilitates an improved understanding of the nature and extent of physical risks climate change driven hazards and their socio economic impacts at different levels of warming with or without adaptation<br>4. CrossEU integrates social sciences and humanities perspectives and insights throughout its entire workflow, engaging stakeholders including representatives of communities or citizen groups, sectoral policymakers, businesses, the scientific community, and civil society, through the entire project cycle.</p>
<p>CROSSEU is an EU funded project, with UK partners funded by UKRI.</p>

Thus, border checks will need to undergo significant transformations in the coming years, both to effectively safeguard the EU’s external borders and to improve the border crossing experience for travellers. Biometrics is one of the fields expected to significantly contribute to the attainment of these goals.<br><br>In light of the above, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency delivered a Technology Foresight Research Study on Biometrics for the Future of Travel. The main objective of this research was the delivery of a study on the future of biometrics for its implementation in border control systems that may benefit the work of the European Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) community in a short (1-5 years), medium (5-10 years) and long term (10+ years) perspective. In particular, this research was to produce a research study that includes the prioritization and roadmapping of emerging relevant biometric technologies with the strongest potential to influence the strategic components of Integrated Border Management and the work of Border Guards themselves. The research study also produced comprehensive tailored technology foresight methodology and supporting tools, properly adapted to Frontex capabilities and organization. Furthermore, it delivered a technology taxonomy for biometrics and biometrics-enabled technological systems. <br><br><br>The obtained findings were to support Frontex in identifying specific research and innovation initiatives which could accelerate the integration of novel biometrics-enabled technological solutions for border checks. This study provides knowledge on how to maximize future benefits of biometrics technology in the border management environment while minimizing its risks and ensuring full compliance with the existing legal, ethical and technological constraints. <br><br>The research study consisted of five phases, which all produced their own set of insights intended to support the EBCG community in decision-making processes, compiled in the main report available <a href=""https://www.frontex.europa.eu/innovation/eu-research/news-and-events/frontex-publishes-technology-foresight-on-biometrics-for-the-future-of-travel-us6C6v"" target=""_blank"">here</a> .&nbsp;</p>

An iterative methodology is rolled out at three successive levels, involving experts in a variety of policy areas and across several EU institutions.</p>
<p><br>Firstly, at the outset, this exercise builds a wider EU community engaged in horizon scanning. Their task at a first level has involved looking for future developments that sit at the margins of current thinking and planning, the so-called ‘signs of new’.</p>
<p><br>Secondly, sense-making workshops are organised on a monthly basis to consider through new lenses the identified ‘signs of new’ collected over the month and find links and interconnections among them across policies and sectors. The aim of these second-level workshops is thus to imagine possible impactful future developments, ‘signals of change’, using the collected signs as prompts.<br></p>
","<p>Thirdly, future impact workshops, conceived as exploratory and prioritisation workshops are organised after conducting a few sense-making workshops. These workshops also include the participation of officials across all ESPAS institutions and aim to prioritise the three potentially most impactful ‘signals of change’ from among those identified at an earlier stage.<br>This careful process results in Horizon Scanning newsletters providing a broader perspective on policy making.</p>

Over generations, these human-nature relations transform dynamically. In doing so, future imaginaries, expectations and visions accompany our commitment to, action in and representation of nature. Genres such as climate fiction and practices such as ocean clean-ups provide insights into (re-)emerging social, cultural and emotional connections between people and nature.<br><br>Future Lives with Oceans and Waters (FLOW) looks forward and explores changing human-nature relationships in the context of aquatic ecosystems. The transdisciplinary project brings together foresight, research on socio-ecological interactions, marine science and natural resource management with young people from across Europe. FLOW aims to create new knowledge and connections to reinforce a new perception of the importance of aquatic ecosystems in the Anthropocene. To do so, the project combines horizon scanning, ethnographic fieldwork, experiential futures workshops and co-creation in an innovative way. As a Research and Innovation Action, FLOW supports the Restore Our Oceans Mission of the EU.</p>

It presents, in a brief and preliminary way, the nine megatrends that are likely to shape the future of our country, with a general description and a list of the most relevant potential impacts: Worsening climate change; Growing pressure on natural resources; Diversifying and changing economic models; Diverging demographic trends; A more urban world; A more digital world; Accelerating technological development; A multipolar world and New challenges to democracy.</p>
","<p>The identification and description of megatrends for Portugal is a work in progress, based on a collaborative, systematic and open process. During this year, with the aim of producing a report and supporting the formulation of public policies, this process will be deepened with workshops, expert consultation and citizen participation.

First, innovation must be value-driven. Second, an ethics of co-responsibility among stakeholders must be implemented. Third, innovation should be made directional and manageable. Fourth, market failures need to be addressed to facilitate necessary transformative changes, especially with regard to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research project will take into account the evolution of Living Labs and various specialized Living Labs (e.g., urban labs, social labs, and responsible Living Labs) to assess to what extent they address these institutional requirements. On this basis, the concept of a new dedicated Living Lab: a Responsible Research and Innovation Lab for Engineering Practices will be introduced. Subsequently this dedicated Living Lab will be operationalised on a theme from the engineering sciences. We will consider innovations stemming from digital tech for Health issues, additive manufacturing or other engineering pratices. We will deploy participatory foresight, to enable a form of anticipatory governance of emerging new innovations.</p>
","<p>This dedicated ling lab is contextualised in a broader context of a deliberative democracy: Living Labs can be seen as spaces for Organisational Learning and Collective Experimentation:Living Labs: ‘real-life test and experimentation environments that foster co-creation and open innovation among the main actors of the Quadruple Helix Model, namely: Citizens, Governmental Organisations, Industrial organisations and Academia’ (ENoLL 2024)It operationalises an important feature of Responsible Research and Innovation: Making stakeholders co-responsible and mutually responsive to each other by engaging them in an open co-creation/ co-enquiry process. (among other on the basis of participatory foresight of emerging technologies and innovations)The idea of 'openess' and 'mutual reponsiveness' as values of actors and institutions will also be subject of analysis.Science and innovation can be better fostered in an open, democratic society than in other types of societies. The norm of civic participation in a ‘democracy’ is a lived ideal for citizens, just as the norm of ‘communalism’ is a lived ideal for the scientific community. Both norms presuppose the values of ‘openness’ and 'mutual responsiveness' among scientist and citizens.This highlights ‘openness’ not as a prescriptive norm but as a value of the institution of science. Simultaneously, ‘openness’ is also an institutional value of a democracy. However, science and democracy are dependent on the extent to which scientist and citizens engage on the basis of these norms. How can we best encourage and incentivise those?</p>

","<p>The shift in China’s strategy focusing towards R&amp;I and transforming the essence of its economy has been complimented with massive public investments in research and technology. In order to tackle critical global issues demanding close scientific and technological cooperation at an international level, EU has identified in China a natural partner able to contribute and complement its own capacity. Beginning of 2015, major European and Chinese Research &amp; Academic organisations, Innovation intermediaries, Public Authorities, Funding agencies and SMEs have teamed up to provide an answer to this necessity and foster EU-China cooperation in the large spectrum of S&amp;T RDI topics.</p>

The aim of this collaboration was to identify so-called social time bombs - in our definition, problems that will be significant in the future or are already known today, but not yet sufficiently addressed by the state administration.&nbsp;</p>
","<p>The learning process itself was also a framing goal of this collaboration, where the unit team wanted to learn some foresight methods and implement them into certain processes of the department's work. The project involved desk research, two expert workshops, expert interviews, and also working closely with leading experts on social issues to develop a set of social issue cards. The final list of social time bombs was used by the unit to define calls for grant programs for nonprofits seeking to address diverse problems through social innovation. Foresight was thus used in this case to direct public funds more effectively, thereby addressing the problems that need to be focused on with an eye to the future.</p>

'Wat als de handel stilvalt' (trans: 'What if the trade would stop') explores the history and flaws of our current global trading systems that led us to crises in production and distribution, as well as possible future alternatives to this system which we can already see forming today.&nbsp;</p>

The aim was also to initiate an expert discussion in Jihlava and to begin a real process of anticipating the impacts of potential development changes and their consequences for socio-economic development in the city. The assessment of the impact of megatrends was carried out in cooperation with regional experts within a series of consecutive foresight workshops. The project results serve as a basis for improving the coordination of activities and expanding cooperation between key regional actors, which will lead to the development of the business environment, the creation of innovations, the improvement of public administration and other activities falling within the competence of the city.</p>

Starting in autumn 2019, five Foresight on Demand projects supported them with foresight expertise and methodology. This project provides the work in support of the Mission Board on Healthy Oceans, Seas, and Coastal and Inland Waters. It encompasses a comprehensive horizon scanning to identify trends and drivers, weak signals and wild cards. On this basis, five focal are were proposed.

","<p>The main mission of the project was to create the basis for creating a vision for the development of Prague in the field of innovation and to connect education, research, public space and business in Prague. The purpose of the project was to identify opportunities for research and innovation in relation to the possible future impacts of global megatrends on Prague and the Prague innovation ecosystem. At the same time, it was an effort to strengthen the cooperation of individual actors in the Prague innovation system to formulate a common vision of the innovation strategy of Prague and the directions of future development of research and innovation activities in this region.</p>

<p>Our mission<br>Our mission is to support the involvement of the Czech Republic in the European Research Area (ERA), to process complex strategic studies for research and innovation and transfer research results to decision-making institutions to improve the quality of their strategic decision-making at the national, regional and European levels, carry out international technology transfer and contribute to increasing the international competitiveness of Czech companies.<br><br>Our history<br>Technology Centre Prague (TC) was established in 1994 as an association of legal entities under the name Technology Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. The founding members were the Academy of Sciences - Institute of Chemical Processes, Institute of Physics, Institute of Plasma Physics, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Institute of Microbiology, in 2005 the company Technology Management,Ltd. became a member of the association.<br><br>The intention to establish the TC had the ideological support of the leadership of the Academy of Sciences at that time, but under conditions the organisation would not draw funds from its central budget. Over time, it became clear that this seemingly negative condition had a fundamentally positive effect on the development and character of the resulting Technology Centre. The permanent need to compete for funds from a wide portfolio of financial sources, including commercial ones, helped to create a very healthy institutional culture for the TC with a clear focus on performance and efficiency.<br><br>The initial aim of the TC was to operate an incubator for spin-off companies with linked to research projects of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. However, the original generous demarcation of the premises for the incubator was corrected over time, as the Academy of Sciences needed space for its own research. It was clear that the road to the TC's economic self-sufficiency does not lead here, and it was therefore necessary to look for new opportunities.<br><br>One of these opportunities was the gradual expansion of the portfolio of services for technology-oriented small companies and the strengthening of the technology and knowledge transfer from the research sphere to industry and directly between innovative enterprises. Over time, this activity has become one of the TC's strongest agendas and is currently implemented through the international Enterprise Europe Network, whose activities in the Czech Republic are coordinated by the Technology Centre. The basic aim of the network is to support the growth of the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises and to facilitate their successful entry into international markets.<br><br>Another such opportunity was the opening of the EU Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development in 1997, even for candidate countries for EU membership. The TC took full advantage of this opportunity and gradually became a respected national information, consultation and training centre that provides comprehensive support for the successful participation of national teams in international research cooperation projects. An extension of this activity was the opening of the Czech Liaison Office for Research, Development and Innovation in Brussels (CZELO) in 2005. The office ensured direct contact between Czech research and European institutions, especially the European Commission and the European Parliament. In 2020, the agenda of the CZELO office was expanded to include the field of education, and its further activities are provided by the House of Foreign Cooperation, a contributory organisation of the Ministry of Education and Culture.<br><br>An important milestone in the development of the TC was the establishment of the agenda for the preparation of analytical and conceptual studies in the field of research and innovation in 2000. Over time, the TC has become a leading national research workplace and think-tank for the management and policy of research, development, and innovation. The TC provides independent information based on comprehensive evaluations of the research, development, and innovation environment as well as on specialised scientometric analyses. An important element is also the development and application of new approaches for the systematic exploration of variants of the future development of society (foresight) and for the assessment of the impact of new technologies on society (technology assessment). These approaches significantly enrich the outputs of evaluations and system analyses and effectively supplement the portfolio of strategic intelligence services for research and innovation provided by the TC, with the aim of improving the quality of strategic decision-making at the national, regional, and European level.<br><br>Receiving support for the reconstruction of its own building in 2009 enabled the concentration of all the TC agendas in one place and the construction of a modern conference centre for holding professional seminars, trainings, and conferences. This has created a unique centre of integrated innovation services that synergistically support each other.<br><br>In 2015, the TC expanded its advanced technology initiatives by signing a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to transfer knowledge and technology from ESA space programmes to application areas outside the space sector and to support the development of companies developing or using space technologies. In this context, the TC has also strengthened the activities of its internal acceleration program BusinessRunway, which focuses mainly on companies dealing with space technologies.<br><br>At the end of 2022, the Technology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences was renamed the Technology Centre Prague, and at the beginning of 2023, a memorandum of cooperation was signed with the Czech Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>The reference scenarios presented in this report aim to help decision makers to increase the preparedness of their organisations under increasingly unpredictable circumstances. The scenarios are four plausible versions of how the world may look like in 2040 and what this would mean for Europe’s global standing. They are called Storms, End game, Struggling synergies, and Opposing views. They do not claim to predict or project how the future may look like but offer strategic reflections, which can serve as a compass for policymakers for navigating through unchartered territories of turbulence, uncertainty, ambiguity and novelty. These four geopolitical scenarios are called ‘Reference’ Foresight Scenarios because they represent a forward-looking framework that provides a reference for use in policymakers’ debates about potential futures.<br></p>
","<p></p>
","<p><strong>Stress-testing policy options with the scenarios </strong></p>
<p>The work with the reference foresight scenarios continued as a pilot process of stress-testing some policy options against a set of Reference foresight scenarios. The process was led by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and applied to a specific EU policy proposal on Standard Essential Patents. The process ran during the initial stage of the impact assessment process, but it was not an official part of it. The results of this pilot helped to understand which policy options are more or less robust and how they can be made more future-proof. The process also provided rich insights into what the challenges and opportunities of this approach are, and into how stress-testing can be further incorporated into EU policymaking. The report provides an example and serve as a guide for any future process of stress-testing policy options against foresight scenarios.</p>

It will establish new or upscaled value chains to boost resilience and sustainability of mountain areas. The first step will be to screen traditional and emerging value chains in all European mountain areas.

Mission Boards were appointed to elaborate visions for the future in five Areas: Adaptation to Climate Change, Including Societal Transformation; Cancer; Healthy Oceans, Seas, and Coastal and Inland Waters; Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities; Soil Health and Food. Starting in autumn 2019, five Foresight on Demand projects supported them with foresight expertise and methodology. This report provides the work in support of the Mission Board on Soil Health and Food. Adopting a long-term perspective, the project first contributed to better understand the drivers, trends and weak signals with the most significant potential to influence the future of soil health and food. With the Mission Board, three scenarios for 2040 were sketched. In the final step, system-thinking knowledge was applied to identify concepts, solutions, and practices able to promote systematic change in the sector.</p>

<p>At Futures Garden, we embark on a visionary journey to redefine policy-making for Europe's future. Our unique platform collaborates with leading futurists, innovative designers, and engaged EU citizens to envision a Europe enriched by diverse potential futures, each with its own opportunities and challenges. Our mission? To revolutionize policy creation by intertwining speculative design with creativity, empathy, and analytical insight. Our four-step approach ensures a comprehensive and impactful exploration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Horizon Scanning</strong>: We dive into cutting-edge ideas and emerging trends, identifying opportunities that could shape Europe's future.</li>
<li><strong>Speculative Design</strong>: Our creative process transforms abstract concepts into tangible, thought-provoking scenarios, making future possibilities more accessible and engaging.</li>
<li><strong>Citizen Engagement</strong>: We delve into the societal implications of these speculative scenarios, gathering diverse perspectives and insights from EU citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Reflection</strong>: The final step involves analyzing the potential impact of these innovative ideas on policy-making, ensuring that future EU policies are forward-thinking, inclusive, and impactful.<br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating fictional artifacts through speculative design</strong><br>Futures Garden aims at creating inspiring alternative future scenarios through the use of fictional future artifacts that invite to reflection and debate. The pilot project took place in 2023 and addressed two themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Dealing with future selves”</strong> explores new ways of being, individually and collectively, examines new practices and technologies that enhance self-reflection and sharing of emotions, which help shape our choices in life and nurture a renewed sense of togetherness.</li>
<li><strong>“Extending human perception to new scales”</strong> explores the richness of non-human intelligences, expanding our attention and appreciation for their unique sensory worlds, their “umwelt” – what they “feel” and how they “think”. In doing so it departs from the human-centric worldview towards a deeper understanding and celebration of life on Earth.<br><br>The resulting fictional artifacts took the form of short, thought-provoking movies – <strong><em>Inwards</em></strong> and <strong><em>Symbiotic</em></strong> – which render the imagined future scenarios more tangible, immersive and engaging.  <br><br>🎬 <a href=""https://www.futuresgarden.eu/artefacts/inwards"" target=""_blank""><strong>Watch </strong><strong><em>""Inwards""</em></strong> </a> - <em>The 2050s a re a time of deep social reconfiguration. No longer believing in the myth of perpetual economic growth, recipes for self-empowerment, and technological fixes, citizens of Europe seek to regain agency by turning inwards.</em><br><em>New cultures of emotional excellence and material minimalism emerge, supported by tools for assisted introspection and emotion sharing. In the wake of this quiet revolution, the social contract progressively integrates a renewed sense of togetherness. </em><br><br>🎬 <a href=""https://www.futuresgarden.eu/artefacts/symbiotic"" target=""_blank""><strong>Watch </strong><strong><em>""Symbiotic</em></strong></a><strong><em>""</em></strong>  - <em>Set in  the Symbiocene era of the 2050s, a time marked by an expanded understanding of intelligence beyond human confines, Symbiotic explores a revolutionary breakthrough. Scientists have created a device that allows humans to experience the perceptions and sensory worlds of other intelligent beings, immersing them in the 'umwelt' of these creatures. This film documents the first groundbreaking experiences through the device, capturing the profound experiences of those who ventured into these new realms of intelligence.</em></li>

With ageing populations, shifting migration patterns, and evolving skill demands, it is crucial to anticipate how these transformations will impact education, research careers, innovation ecosystems, and funding landscapes.<br><br>This commissioned study for DG RTD under the Foresight on Demand Framework Contract seeks to develop scenarios until 2050, and to understand the implications of demographic change on the  R&amp;I system. By exploring weak signals,  trends and interactions—including the role of emerging technologies such as AI—we aim to identify strategic policy options to support a competitive, sustainable, and fair Europe. The study will provide insights to help policymakers and stakeholders design resilient R&amp;I policies that respond to demographic shifts.<br></p>

Through this project’s multiple phases and scientifically led by the Fraunhofer ISI, teams consisting of mainly asylum and migration experts from the EUAA, asylum authorities of several EU+ countries, the European Commission (DG HOME, Joint Research Centre), Frontex, Europol, UNHCR and ICMPD created a set of coherent future scenarios – narratives that enable policy and decision makers to better perceive and respond to the complexity and uncertainty of possible futures. <br><br>The scenario development process began with the identification of a number of factors that were both external to the EU+ countries and driving change in international protection. Over the course of three workshops, EUAA experts together with representatives of national asylum authorities and partner EU institutions assessed the boundaries of each factor’s possible development in the future and constructed several constellations of these fundamental factors. Such constellations of the fundamental factors were further refined and turned into four unique and viable future scenarios.<br><br>Finally, a Delphi survey gathered quantitative and qualitative expert feedback on the likelihood and time-scale for critical aspects of each scenario.<br><br>In addition to the process benefits for the people involved, the following results are now publicly available in the reports:<br><br>Overview of critical influencing factors and possible development paths;<br>Four scenario narratives outlining the option space for the next ten years;<br>Persona descriptions supporting the immersion in the respective scenario;<br>Results of a Delphi survey on critical aspects of the four scenarios;<br>Compilation of wildcards and their significance in the context of the scenarios; and<br>Critical challenges for actors in the context of international protection for individual scenarios and across all scenarios</p>

It  is  simultaneously instrumental to the green and digital transition and exposed to its effects. A steady supply of (green)  create reusable and recyclable consumer goods. On the other hand, chemical synthesis is an energy-intensive  process  inherently  dependent  on  carbon-based  feedstock  (currently  derived  almost exclusively from fossil fuels). In addition, chemistry is a global industry with international value chains, where the EU both collaborates and competes with other countries for materials, knowledge and skills. <br><br>Transforming  the European  chemical  industry  into  a sustainable  motor  for  the  green  and  digital transition  will require  investments in  infrastructure, assets  and skills.  Focus  should  be placed  on chemicals that  are  crucial to  this  Twin Transition,  , or both. The long  lead time required  for  the  deployment  of  infrastructure  and  the  development  of  skills  means  that  such investments must be made now to achieve targets set for 2050. <br><br>In connection with these issues, the report at hand aims to give insights into a number of value chains that  are  strategic  to  EU  economy.  It  considers  which  chemicals  and  innovations  are  vital  to transforming these value chains as well as rendering them more resilient and future-fit. To this end, a participatory workshop-based foresight approach was implemented to provide a unique set of insights from stakeholders and translate them into actions and policy recommendations. <br>Chapter 1 provides a general introduction into foresight and an overview of the project, the definitions used, the methodology applied and the approach to project implementation. <br><br>Chapter 2 details the 20 Critical Chemicals and 10 key Future Innovations, needed to secure the four Strategic  Value  Chains  under  consideration:  Batteries,  Connected  Clean  &amp;  Autonomous  Vehicles, Hydrogen Technologies &amp; Systems, and Microelectronics &amp;  Industrial IoT.  These value chains were selected as highly dependent on chemicals and non-overlapping with  other EC research initiatives. Those Critical Chemicals and Future Innovations are listed in the tables below. <br><br>Chapter 3 presents  In addition, each so-called factsheet contains roadmaps of actions needed to increase those value chains resilience as well as describes  chemicals and the implementation of innovations. Thus, the roadmaps enable the identification and assessment of potential future actions. <br><br>Chapter 4 contains a set of key policy recommendations addressed to policy stakeholders. They focus on  accelerating  the  digital  and  green  transformation  of  the  entire  chemical  industry,  and  were collected from experts throughout the project. <br><br>Finally, the Annex details methodologies and underlying analyses.</p>

<li>Mapped existing policy relevant European R&amp;I findings with high potential to inform policy making for economic and social resilience, and to help address societal challenges and integrated them into a knowledge base.</li>
<li>Set up a toolbox and guideline for a scenario proccess that helps to stress test the usefulness of these policy solutions for a specific context and challenge&nbsp;</li>
<li>Implemented 10 pilot cases called '<a href=""https://futuresilience.eu/future-resilience-labs"" target=""_blank"">Future Resilience Labs</a> ' that conduct this participative scenario process with  multiple stakeholders to develop tailored strategies for their local context and challenges. Lab topics range from climate change related natural disasters via migration and integration, housing and spatial mobility issues to cybersecurity threats, labor skill shortages and health system challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the Lab results and process experiences the project will generate a Knowledge Base of the successfully tested research findings with high capacity to inform policy actors and a Toolbox of methods for testing policy relevant research findings with participatory Foresight approaches at the center.</p>

","<p><strong>The Resonant Future Self Framework</strong> is an experimental methodology that merges strategic foresight, immersive narrative design, biometric sensing and applied neuroscience to help people <em>feel </em>their way into personally meaningful futures. Participants co-create six AI-generated “future-self” stories based on a deep self-inquiry, then step inside those stories. While they watch - and sometimes <em>star</em> in - the simulation, EEG, heart-rate variability, respiration, skin conductance and peripheral temperature are recorded in real time to detect moments of coherence or dissonance between the body and the imagined life path. These physiological “resonance markers” complement post-session journaling to reveal which futures evoke a profound sense of <em>rightness</em> and which trigger resistance or cognitive overload .<br><br>The practice unfolds in nine interconnected steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <em>Discover</em> personal strengths, conflicts and aspirations;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <em>Reflect</em> by generating diverse narrative futures with generative-AI support;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <em>Select </em>the two scenarios that feel most alive;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <em>Embody</em> them in immersive media while gathering biometric data;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <em>Review</em> the combined subjective/objective signals;&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. <em>Activate</em> the preferred future through weekly micro-practices in daily life;&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. <em>Backcast</em> concrete milestones linking present and desired identity;&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. <em>Revisit </em>the experience after six-to-eight weeks;&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. <em>Second Test</em> under identical biometric conditions to measure shifts in alignment .<br></p>
","<p>An <strong>April 2025</strong> <strong>single-participant pilot </strong>demonstrated that personalised immersive future-self simulations can indeed generate rich, differentiated biometric signatures - and that those signatures align closely with felt meaning. During two iterations of an <strong>AI-generated, audio-visual journey into imagined future identities, EEG, heart-rate, respiration, skin conductance and peripheral temperature</strong> were recorded continuously. The aggregated signal showed alternating phases of elevated<strong> gamma activity</strong> and transient heart-rate acceleration (markers of emotional arousal) followed by stretches of sustained <strong>alpha rhythms </strong>and increased heart-rate variability (often linked to calm, integrative attention). Immediately after each immersion, the participant completed reflective journaling; the qualitative entries mapped almost point-for-point onto the physiological timeline, suggesting that this form of embodied resonance mapping can translate subjective alignment into measurable data.</p>
<p><br>The session also surfaced practical insights - such as the need to calibrate narrative intensity to avoid cognitive overload and to provide structured debrief protocols - that now inform the forthcoming group trials. Although limited to a single case, these early findings validate the technical pipeline and bolster the central hypothesis that <strong>combining AI-personalised storytelling with real-time biofeedback offers a powerful pathway to purpose discovery.</strong><br><br>Building on that proof-of-concept, the research progresses through three phases:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>(1) Individual immersive foresight to refine protocols;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>(2) Group-based resonance testing to explore social amplification and shared insight; and&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>(3) Scalability studies that port the method to mobile-friendly, light-weight XR so schools, universities and coaching programmes can adopt it at low cost.<br><br></p>
","<p>By integrating AI-assisted narrative personalisation, emotionally rich immersion and rigorously measured biofeedback, the framework goes beyond analytical scenario planning toward lived, embodied exploration of identity, purpose and direction. <strong>It addresses a gap in learning and development:</strong> supporting people not merely in planning their future, but in emotionally inhabiting it. Potential applications range from <strong>purpose-driven education and career guidance to mental-well-being</strong> interventions. <br><br>Future work will expand the participant base, automate parts of the workflow, and study long-term behavioural impact, moving the framework from an experimental prototype to a scalable toolkit for purpose discovery across Europe.</p>
","<p><strong>The Resonant Future Self Framework</strong> was first introduced at the <strong>Futures4Europe Conference 2025: Exploring Future-Oriented Collective Intelligence in Vienna (May 15–16, 2025)</strong>, hosted by the <strong>AIT Austrian Institute of Technology</strong> as part of the <strong>Eye of Europe</strong> project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, it will be presented at <strong>The First International Conference on AI-based Media Innovation</strong> <strong>AIMEDIA 2025 in Venice</strong> <strong>(July 6–10, 2025)</strong>, within the <strong>AI in Immersive Media </strong>track.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These high-level events mark the launch of a broader dissemination phase, as the framework evolves from an experimental prototype into a practical methodology for education, coaching, and human development - bridging foresight, emotional intelligence, and immersive AI.</p>

<p>As a service provider in the field of international cooperation for sustainable development and international education work, we are dedicated to shaping a future worth living around the world. We have over 50 years of experience in a wide variety of areas, including economic development and employment promotion, energy and the environment, and peace and security. The diverse expertise of our federal enterprise is in demand around the globe – from the German Government, European Union institutions, the United Nations, the private sector, and governments of other countries. We work with businesses, civil society actors and research institutions, fostering successful interaction between development policy and other policy fields and areas of activity. Our main commissioning party is the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).</p>
<p><ins>How GIZ uses Foresight Methods:</ins> As a federal enterprise working in the fields of international cooperation for sustainable development and international education, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH is greatly affected by the business environment in which it operates and by trends in Germany, Europe and the world. Dealing with the resulting uncertainty, complexity and fast-paced change is often very challenging. This makes it important for GIZ to understand the underlying drivers of change and possible future developments so that it can prepare for the future and for the crises it will have to address, ultimately making the company and its staff more resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Set against the backdrop of these issues, <strong>EUARENAS</strong> has been investigating how cities and urban spaces can strengthen legitimacy, identification and engagement within the democratic public sphere. Specifically, <strong>EUARENAS </strong>has been exploring how participation and deliberation in democracy and decision-making can be increased, and how voices and communities who are excluded from such arenas can be more actively involved.</p>
","<p>Foresight is one of the research strands present in <strong>EUARENAS</strong>. In this project, foresight is both a tool for understanding democratic innovations as they emerge, and for engaging citizens and other actors in such innovations within the participatory and deliberative realms. Mixed method approaches to foresight that incorporate a diversity of activities such as media discourse analysis, lived experience storytelling, social media analysis, three horizons mapping, driver-mapping, scenario and visioning exercises and policy stress- testing have been used in <strong>EUARENAS</strong> to investigate and hypothesise over future trends and scenarios in participatory democracies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this work, we propose the following recommendations for Cities wanting to strive towards more equitable local democracies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Address structural barriers to participation</li>
<li>Build relationships of trust</li>
<li>Invest in formal and civic education</li>
<li>Make decisions for the long-term</li>
</ol>
<p>A more equitable, inclusive local democracy landscape is not too far in the distance for us to conceive it being possible. In fact, <strong>the future is now</strong> – the seeds to create it are already being planted, they just need nurturing by:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling and mainstreaming existing pilot or niche practices that are working locally – whether that beparticipatory budgeting, citizen assemblies or other smaller-scale projects – so that these become thenew ‘status quo’</li>
<li>Adopting test and learn approaches to promote experimentation and on-going learning – this will enableongoing innovation and be responsive to society's needs</li>
<li>Finding ways to celebrate and connect-up the small changes that are taking place - this will help people see that progress is being made, even when it feels like things are changing too slow</li>
</ul>

Apart from granting support for local hosts from all Creative Europe countries for the mobility of artists and cultural professionals, the project also included research on mobility in culture and the design of policy recommendations.</p>
","<p>In the research, the mobility of artists and cultural professionals is understood as the temporary, cross-border travel of artists and cultural professionals with the purpose of creating, connecting, exploring and learning. The research was carried out by experts from different disciplines with Dea Vidović being the research leader. As a result of the aforementioned research, in 2022 Kultura Nova Foundation published a 4-volume publication. Each volume represents one of the research sections:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) conceptual framework of mobility in culture;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) the study on mobility in culture from the perspectives of artists, cultural professionals, hosts and funders;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) an evaluation of i-Portunus Houses mobility grant scheme and&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) scenario for the future of mobility in culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The research covers a wide range of topics related to mobility in culture, such as its participatory and networking dimension, its digital dimension and virtual mobility, as well as its green dimension. The culmination of the research, alongside extensive recommendations and action points for sustainable mobility, is Scenario for the Future which introduces a new concept of ""slow mobility"".</p>

<p><br><strong>Futures Literacy</strong></p>
<p>In our ever-changing world, parents, caregivers, teachers, and educators are faced with the challenge of preparing children for a future that is difficult to predict. How can we equip ourselves and younger generations with the necessary tools and skills to navigate the unknown? This is where futures literacy comes into play. While no-one can truly predict the future, by integrating future thinking into education, we acquire the tools to anticipate and navigate the complexities of an uncertain world, fostering innovation, adaptability, and resilience, in line with the goals of the European Year of Skills (May 2023 – May 2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""https://ed.ted.com/future-forward"" target=""_blank"">Future Forward</a>, a 20-lesson  program offers a unique opportunity for parents, teachers, and anyone curious about the exploration of the future. This crash course into foresight provides insights into future thinking, anticipation and foresight, opening doors to a better informed and imaginative future.</p>
<p><br>The Topics</p>
<p>The lessons resolve around 5 topics:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Perception of time; How we perceive time is connected to how we understand the future. Explore your perception of time and the future from multiple perspectives to help develop your futures literacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Futures mindset; Learn to see the world as a futurist! By challenging assumptions, developing a critical gaze, and understanding the interconnectedness of the world, you can imagine possible and preferable futures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Multiple futures; There is no single future, but a landscape of constantly emerging and evolving possibilities. Contemplate a plurality of scenarios and visions for some of this century’s most pressing issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Investing in imaginations; How do we begin to imagine more than one viable future? When we open our imaginations, the possibilities become endless. We each have the capacity to explore, shape and imagine alternative futures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Taking action; Imagine your ideal world 20 years in the future. What does it look like? How can you achieve it? Learn how you can take an active role in creating a better and more positive tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>UNESCO champions a capability-based approach to using-the-future. Futures Literacy empowers the innate human capacity to imagine, it is a skill that everyone can develop. In becoming futures literate we enhance our agency, developing our abilities to identify novelty, prepare, adapt and invent as changes occur in the complex world we live in.

It connects leading European demographers and economists with experts from policy and stakeholder engagement. The FutuRes Policy Lab developped eight qualitative scenarios, which describe possible futures of Europe, centered around the continent's population development. These scenarios are based on sound research data which were connected narratively by policymakers and other experts.</p>
","<p>European societies are ageing. This puts strain on labour markets, social systems, families, and intergenerational solidarity. Additionally, crises and shocks occur as a result of the changing global climate, violent conflict and pandemics.<br><br>The challenge of the day is to create social policies that are resilient. Resilient in the sense of enduring, flexible, adjustable, but also sustainable, humane and fair. In this, the role of demographic researchers is to analyse population data and to provide data analysis and modelling that can support policy-making for a better future.<br><br>FutuRes is directed by Prof. Arnstein Aassve of Bocconi University in Milan, one of Europe’s leading experts on crisis resilience. The project brings together a transdisciplinary group of experts to identify policies for the resilience of Europe’s ageing population. It is funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation programme.<br>An exceptional feature of FutuRes is that dialogue between the research team, policymakers and other stakeholders has been underway since the beginning. “Behind us are the days when researchers simply present their findings at the very end of a project”, says Prof. Aassve. Alongside its research, FutuRes will implement a Policy Lab, where scientists will match their research to practical challenges to resilience and aging, and propose knowledge-based policies.  Through a series of larger and smaller events across all three years of the project, this transdisciplinary engagement, will shape the FutuRes research and ensure actionable results.</p>
