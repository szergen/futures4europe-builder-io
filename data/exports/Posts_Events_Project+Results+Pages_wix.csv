Contemporary societies increasingly rely on Big Tech for different functions, such as work, communication, consumption, and self-expression.</p>
","<p>""Big tech"" companies, often referred to as the giants in the technology industry, have a significant impact on the global market, economy, and society. Decision makers, regulators and stakeholders grapple with the challenges of uneven competition and the political and ethical implications arising from the actions of these major players, as well as their data usage practices. In addition, the majority of large high-tech corporations are not headquartered in Europe.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the challenges posed by the future of Big Tech abound: Should Europe try to develop its own Big Tech as well? Should Big Tech be left free to carry on unimpeded? Should governments impose detailed standards of conduct? Foresight experts investigated what the situation could look like in 2040 and the implications for the future of Big Tech in research and innovation policy.</p>
<p>Based on the discussions stemming from the foresight experts, 4 scenarios were conceived:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Winner techs all</strong> – The economy depends on infrastructures owned and honed by Big Tech. This growing reliance is balanced by benefit sharing arrangements and empowerment of businesses. Stability is underpinned by the existing framework of Globalisation, supported by both informal (G7, G20) and formal institutions (IMF, World Bank). The US continues as the dominant superpower, setting the global agenda, while the EU's role is more constrained, fitting into the international labour division.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Pax technologica</strong> – The economy balances between pro-global business interests and pro-local political constraints, where 'local' refers to cooperative yet competitive groups of countries. Despite the drive for economies of scale and scope, increased regulation and stricter borders have led to more fragmented supply chains focused on suppliers within mega-regions of preferential partners, prioritizing stability over efficiency. The EU acts as a nexus for these external and internal pressures, embodying the ""Brussels Consensus.""&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Re-match</strong> – The development of nations and regions is shaped by their unique paths in a diverse international landscape, where proactive and coordinated policies are increasingly relevant. After a period of rapid expansion, Big Tech's growth has slowed, giving way to innovative cross-regional and trans-sectoral entities that thrive in a complex economy with active public sector involvement. The EU plays a key role in fostering network building and protecting vital components of the modern economy, balancing citizen engagement and global fragmentation.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Closet liberalism</strong> – In this scenario, commercial and financial integration advances, with power increasingly crossing national borders and impacting state sovereignty. Large multinationals, particularly tech monopolies, influence public governance, though their maturity leads to higher costs and poorer quality. This environment, characterized by a network of competition authorities, presents opportunities for decentralization, particularly at local and city levels, while the US prioritizes its interests and the EU advocates for market order, with internal members reinterpreting rules for their benefit.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the experts concluded that Europe needs its own leading actors in the digital world. The key question remains how compatible they would be in an existing market and what they would mean for competition and equality in Europe. EU-based research and development startups receive a lot of offers from bigger tech giants, calling for closer monitoring of the global connectivity of ecosystems to avoid the gobbling up of in-house expertise.</p>
<p>Grappling with Big Tech scenarios raised issues tied to ethics, for which project <a href=""http://www.techethos.eu/"" target=""_self"">TechEthos</a> provided feedback. This project, which seeks to create ethical guidelines for emerging technologies, aims to define potential ethical implications of future technologies. They believed the scenarios were well defined but lacked a focus on societal and ethical implications. When examining technological risks, the scenarios focused on whether specific technologies prioritised the achievement of their intended functions, rather than considering the ethical implications and transformations these technologies might undergo. Their pointers turned toward copyright issues and the ways in which creative generative companies are restructuring their human labour. They asked scenario experts how a responsible innovative model for Big Tech might look so that new narratives can be strived towards.</p>
<p>Project <a href=""https://project-plus.eu/the-project/"" target=""_self"">PLUS</a> offered a step in that direction by analysing how the platform economy affects work, welfare, and social protection, employing an innovative approach that spans multiple cities. From drone deliveries to automated driving systems, from the artificial intelligence of home assistant devices to the digitization of agriculture, they stressed that today it is the major platform economy players like Amazon, rather than the public sector, which develop patents for new technologies. This could be a feature of scenarios with a prominent role for the EU.</p>
<p>One participant argued in favour of building the capacity for data analysis for public purposes. While the business sector can do this efficiently, the public sector lags behind. They argued that the public sector should be empowered with the capacity to exploit data this way. At the same time, a greater effort is needed to use data repositories in Europe. However, large companies already have a big head start, thus increasing the competition with existing big data infrastructures.</p>
<p>The capability to exploit data proves as important as the technologies themselves, indicating that the future of Big Tech will not only be shaped by technological advancements but also by the mastery of data utilisation. This intertwining of data exploitation and technology underscores the potential for even greater influence and innovation in the years ahead.</p>

How shall these policies help us explore and respond to the uncertainties of the future?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finding answers to these questions requires first of all imagining the context, in which future EU R&amp;I policies might be situated. For doing this, we need to explore developments both at global level and within the European Union.</p>
","<p><strong>1. Why Multi-Level Context Scenarios?</strong></p>
<p>Several recent developments strongly suggest that a new ‘world order’ is evolving, replacing the relatively short period characterised by US dominance,  which, in turn, followed the bipolar world (the cold war between the blocs led by the US and the USSR) that existed for several decades after WW2. This new world order will be a multipolar one, but we cannot know yet how these ‘poles’ would behave. Thus, it is an imperative to consider several options. To do so, we propose exploring three different types of multipolar worlds:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A) ‘poles’ genuinely collaborating when tackling global challenges,&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) antagonistic groups of countries that are nevertheless willing to engage in limited co-operation, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>C) at least one ‘pole’ is openly hostile towards others.1</p>
<p>The EU might also evolve along different paths, and thus we have enriched these multipolar scenarios at global level by also exploring two variants of how the EU might evolve in each of the global scenarios. The two variants of EU development<br>we consider are i) a dynamic and resilient variant and ii) a destabilised and thus vulnerable variant. Preferably, the EU will be strong, dynamic and resilient, but we cannot be sure about this, and thus need to consider a possible weakening of the EU’s position in the world.</p>
<p>By considering these two futures for the EU in each of the three global multipolar scenarios, we arrive at a set of six scenarios in total (Table 1). Due to the explicit consideration of multiple development paths at both the global and EU levels, we obtain a multi-level architecture of scenarios. It is certainly more demanding to analyse the six possible futures stemming from our 2x3 structure, but it provides more nuanced insights on the possible contexts for the EU R&amp;I policies, and thus these policies can be underpinned by more relevant analyses, considering several options in a systematic and transparent way.</p>
<p>This multi-level nature is what distinguishes our set of scenarios from other recent scenario projects that we have drawn upon as sources of inspiration. The notion of a multi-track scenario, coined by the recent OECD project on Global Scenarios 2035,2 stresses the idea of rather autonomous developments paths of different clusters (groups) of countries. This idea is shared by the EC SAFIRE <br>scenarios,3 which also propose almost autonomous future pathways of different world regions. The global dimension of our scenario matrix further differentiates the multi-track idea into three variants of how groups of countries might relate to each other: genuine collaboration, limited co-operation, or open hostility.4</p>
<p>The JRC’s background report to the EC Strategic Foresight Report 20215 with its emphasis on the concept of open strategic autonomy of the EU emphasises the relationship between the EU and its global context, but it does not distinguish <br>multiple development pathways at both global and EU levels. We argue, however, that this distinction is particularly productive to explore options for future EU R&amp;I policies, because the room – and need – for manoeuvre depends on global opportunities and constraints, as well as on the collaboration and disparities between the national innovation systems of EU Member States.</p>
<p>Of course, other factors of relevance to EU R&amp;I policies also influence the EU and the global landscapes, such as the emergence of new types of non-state actors, or growing concerns about global challenges that are shared by all countries.</p>
","<p>Considering several types of a multipolar world offers an opportunity to think about different types of political and policy stances vis-à-vis Russia, China, and the US, which is important in order to derive future-proof implications and devise a future-proof EU R&amp;I policy strategy. For example, the EU can make cognisant, well-considered preparations for a hostile, as well as a limited or genuinely collaborative relationship with Russia in the coming decades. While the latter may seem difficult to imagine in Spring 2022, it should not be discarded in the longer term. Further, this structure makes it easier to recognise that we need to put more emphasis on the security of the EU, and thus its cohesion. It also implies the need of taking a more pronounced ethical stance by the EU when considering various options, actual and potential internal tensions, as well as external threats and challenges. In view of how the global relations might evolve in the three different world orders, the EU needs to take a position that is both robust with regard to these three possible future worlds and at the same time compatible with the basic values that the EU aspires to defend. These choices are likely to have crucial repercussions on its R&amp;I policies as well.<br><br><strong>2. Scenarios Descriptions</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Major common features of the three multipolar worlds and general observations </strong></p>
<p>The world is running on multiple separate tracks in all the three multipolar worlds, while the level of co-operation and conflict between the poles varies in the different scenarios. Attitudes towards key determinants of well-being (inequality, freedom of expression, surveillance, ...) are highly divergent between the groups of countries, of which the various poles are composed. Thus, social tensions and inequalities might be high in one ‘pole’, while in another one a socially balanced development is of high priority. That would possibly lead to mass migration from one pole to another (unless prevented by force). Planetary boundaries – especially biodiversity, climate change, quality of soil, air, and water – might be either neglected or respected in the different ‘poles’, possibly causing major global challenges – or even disasters – with their further economic, social, annd environmental repercussions. These major issues are tackled in markedly different ways in the three types of multipolar worlds, just as access to critical resources.</p>
<p>State actors, businesses, NGOs, and newly emerging actors might behave in different ways in the same scenario. Competition and collaboration might occur in parallel (both among and inside the ‘poles’, as well as among the different types of actors). Co-operation in research, technological development and innovation activities (attitudes towards collaboration, as well as its domains, channels and forms, the types of actors engaged) are likely to vary across the scenario sketches. Finally, the actual ways, in which the EU tackles the major challenges and disruptions could vary in the six scenarios, depending on to what extent the various major actors (the EP, the Council, the Commission, big businesses, NGOs, ...) can shape the agenda and control the actions needed to implement the decisions. All these aspects are to be explored during the more detailed scenario building phase of the project.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 A genuinely collaborative multipolar world </strong></p>
<p>Given the emerging global challenges, there are strong and successful efforts to set up global governance mechanisms to tackle critical issues (climate, biodiversity, migration, access to energy and other natural resources, regional conflicts, ...). Sustainable development goals (SDGs) are at the top of the agenda. Planetary boundaries are major concerns for all major stakeholders in all (most) poles. Businesses are active partners in global trade, investment, and innovation activities across the poles.</p>
<p><em>A) Thriving in collaboration: A strong, dynamic EU in a genuinely collaborative multipolar world</em></p>
<p>The EU is politically and financially strong enough to tackle the major societal and environmental challenges in its own territory with innovative solutions, supported by effective R&amp;I policies, orchestrated between the EU and member states’ levels, as well as across the relevant policy domains. These strengths and successes make the EU a leading partner – able to co-shape the agenda – in global collaborations, which, in turn, also creates favourable conditions to these efforts.</p>
<p><em>D) Decline, despite collaboration: A destabilised EU in a genuinely collaborative multipolar world</em></p>
<p>Given its decline, the EU can tackle only a few of the major societal and environmental challenges in its own territory. One of the root causes is the poor policy orchestration between the EU and member states’ levels, as well as across the relevant policy domains. The EU is a neglected partner in global collaborations and can take advantage of the favourable global framework conditions to a rather limited extent.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 A multipolar world with limited co-operation </strong></p>
<p>Different systems and standards in different parts of the world have solidified, creating several parallel groups of states, which, however, ‘talk to each other’. Leading powers of the poles gradually recognise the need for international co-operation (e.g. given major disasters) in tackling the most urgent (and possibly less demanding) issues. Limited multilateral (global) governance mechanisms are in place to tackle these carefully selected critical issues. Success is achieved in tackling jointly some of these issues, lowering the probability of major conflicts. Some planetary boundaries are respected in most poles. Global trade, investment, and innovation activities across the poles occur, but to a rather limited extent.</p>
<p><em>B) Respected partner: A strong, dynamic EU in a multipolar world with limited co-operation </em></p>
<p>The EU is politically and financially strong enough to tackle the major societal and environmental challenges in its own territory with innovative solutions, supported by effective R&amp;I policies, orchestrated between the EU and member states’ levels, as well as across the relevant policy domains. The outcomes of these efforts, however, are severely constrained by the limited nature of global collaboration. Given its strengths and successes, the EU is a respected partner in global co-operations. Yet, it is not strong enough to extend and intensify global co-operations due to the limited commitments of the other poles.</p>
<p><em>E) Negligible partner: A destabilised EU in a multipolar world with limited co-operation</em></p>
<p>Given its decline, the EU can tackle only a few of the major societal and environmental challenges in its own territory. One of the root causes is the poor policy orchestration between the EU and member states’ levels, as well as across the relevant policy domains. Further, the outcomes of the EU’s weak efforts are severely constrained by the limited nature of global co-operations. Given its weaknesses, the EU is neglected partner even in the limited global co-operations, cannot co-shape the agenda.<br></p>
<p><strong>2.4. A hostile multipolar world</strong></p>
<p>At least 1-2 strong pole/s want/s to impose its values (ideologies), political, and socio-economic structures on other(s). The expansionist pole/s encourage/s their favoured firms to encroach into other pole/s to undermine that/ those. Antagonistic ideologies (political systems) first cripple global co-operation altogether. Simply it is impossible to tackle global critical issues. That triggers ever more severe major conflicts, leading to open hostility (cold and hybrid regional wars; the fatality of an all-out [nuclear] war is understood, though.)&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>C) Deterring fortress: A strong, dynamic EU in a hostile multipolar world</em></p>
<p>The EU is forced to focus on defence and security issues, at the expense of tackling major societal and environmental challenges in its own territory. Given its economic strengths, resources required for significantly improving its defence capabilities might be sufficient, especially if it can form alliances with other pole/s.6</p>
<p><em>F) Frail fiefdom: A weak, vulnerable EU in a hostile multipolar world</em></p>
<p>The EU is forced to focus on defence and security issues, and thus largely neglects societal and environmental challenges. Given its poor economic performance, resources might not be sufficient even for significantly improving its defence capabilities.<br></p>
<p><strong>3. The Added Value of Multi-level Context Scenarios </strong></p>
<p>Multi-level scenarios offer the possibility of capturing the complexity of contexts for policies in a systematic, structured, and thus transparent way. By definition, though, they are complex and more demanding than those that consider only a single governance level. Hence, multi-level scenarios are built and used far less frequently than single-level scenarios. Yet, for EU R&amp;I policies both levels of contexts are of paramount importance: i) how global issues might unfold (what major issues, in need of global responses, would evolve and what types of global responses can be expected from various poles); and ii) in what EU context the EU R&amp;I policies should be devised and implemented (especially the position of the EU vis-à-vis other major global players; the decision-making mechanism inside the EU, e.g. orchestration of policies across policy domains and governance levels; available resources for R&amp;I policies).</p>
<p>To start with the global level, the three multipolar world scenarios highlight that the global co-ordination mechanisms, including global markets, do not work satisfactorily for actors having a decisive power to shape political, economic, societal, and environmental developments, and thus they opt for following their own track. This basic feature is not a speculation; it is the reality to be faced by all actors. Only one of these scenarios depicts a world order, in which the poles are willing to collaborate when tackling global challenges, notably security and peace; access to energy, other critical resources, and food; environment (climate, soil, air, water, biodiversity), and migration, to mention just the most fundamental ones. These imply a strong need for effective orchestration of policies and other actors’ steps at the global level. Yet, in the other two multipolar worlds co-operation is either limited among the poles, or it is not only missing, but open hostility is the context. In a bit simplified way, we can claim that the EU had been created assuming the first type of world order: global co-ordination mechanisms, especially global markets work for all major actors in an acceptable way. Now it finds itself exposed to the realities of a multi-track world, at best with limited co-operation – but currently ‘tainted’ by open hostility as well, right at its Eastern borders.</p>
<p>Depending on its own path, the EU can react to these new realities in different ways in the various multipolar scenarios. R&amp;I activities must play a major role in finding relevant answers to these challenges, and thus R&amp;I policies should deal with these issues.<br>Just to illustrate it with the energy issue, in scenario A) the EU has access to energy sources globally. Further, it can collaborate with all major global actors in shaping and pursuing an energy R&amp;I agenda7 at a relatively leisurely way and speed – and as a strong partner. Besides the global collaborative project, the EU can – and need to – still pursue its own energy R&amp;I agenda. In scenario D) the EU can still collaborate on these issues with the other major partners, but given its weak position, would not be able to influence the agenda: it can only play a role decided by the major global players. In both cases the energy R&amp;I agenda for collaboration would be mainly shaped by climate and economic considerations. Collaborations are likely to beneficial in either case, although to a significantly different extent, depending on the EU’s ability to shape the agenda.</p>
<p>In scenario B) the EU ́s access to energy sources is more limited geographically. It can still co-operate with some major global actors in shaping and pursuing an energy R&amp;I agenda, but the scope of these co-operations is narrower, and co-operation is less intense, compared to scenario A). In scenario E), the EU ́s role, and thus the benefits it can gain, are more limited than in scenarios B) and D). In scenarios B) and E) the energy R&amp;I agenda would be mainly shaped also by climate and economic considerations. The weight of these factors would be defined by the nature of the limited co-operations, in which the global partners are willing to enter. A ‘variable geometry’ of co-operations is likely to emerge; different combinations of poles would agree on different types of co-operations (e.g., in terms of themes, intensity, and forms of co-operation) and these are likely to change over time.</p>
<p>In scenario C), the EU has access to energy sources only in territory of those poles that are not hostile to it. It can only co-operate with its allies in this openly hostile world order. The scope and intensity of energy R&amp;I co-operations would be determined by the nature and territorial aspects of hostility. Given its strengths, the EU can co-shape the co-operative energy R&amp;I agenda with its allies. In scenario F), the EU ́s role, and thus the benefits it can gain, are more limited than in scenario C). In scenarios C) and F) the energy R&amp;I agenda would be mainly shaped by security considerations, eclipsing climate and economic ones. Moreover, R&amp;D results and the impacts of innovations would be requested more urgently by all stakeholders. That implies significantly stronger pressures on R&amp;I actors than in scenarios A), B), D), and E), on the one hand, but also larger funds would be made available for these activities, on the other, at the expense of financing some other R&amp;I activities.</p>
<p>Although we have only hinted at some important implications of the energy issue given space limits, it needs to be stressed that the critical issues identified above are strongly interrelated. Just to illustrate the importance of their co-evolution – their impacts on each other –, let’s start again from the energy angle. The available energy sources (their types) and our way to use energy has major <br>impacts on the environment (climate change, quality of soil, air, and water, as well as on biodiversity, e.g., insects pollinating plants), and thus on food security (quantity and quality of food supply). Security (geopolitical) issues would determine access to natural gas. As natural gas is a major input for fertilisers, there will be major implications for food security through this chain of impacts, too. Another example is that security (geopolitical) issues have direct impacts on food supply e.g., from Russia and Ukraine,8 and thus on food security in the EU and elsewhere. Climate change, security in its strict sense, and food security in other continents can easily trigger mass migration. Clearly, implications for R&amp;I policies, stemming from these cross-impacts, need to be considered as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More generally, the EU can use its R&amp;I policies for science diplomacy in different ways and to different extent in the six scenarios sketched above. For example, in scenario A) it can initiate global R&amp;I alliances for the pursuit of solutions to global problems (e.g., energy, climate, food security, new pandemics, digital safety and security). It can also promote global science as a ‘world public good’ and use its higher education systems to attract global talent to work in the EU or collaborate with EU partners upon return to their home countries. These opportunities would be significantly more limited in all the other scenarios (in terms of thematic and geographical scope, as well as intensity) given the EU’s own strengths, on the one hand, and the basic features of the world order, on the other. Further, the EU’s own interests would also differ significantly in the six scenarios, and thus it would – need to – put different emphasis on building its own strengths in isolation vs. seeking different types of co-operation.</p>
<p>Considering multiple futures is a necessary precondition to devise ‘future-proof’ R&amp;I policy strategies (including priorities, relevant policy tools, as well as governance structures and methods), that is, strategies that would be effective in most of the plausible futures. Our intention with this blog post is not to offer strategic advice, not even to identify a set of the most relevant and pressing strategic issues; rather, we would like to ignite a heated, but thorough, systematic, and transparent discussion on the possible future contexts for the EU R&amp;I policies as a starting point for strategy setting, and thus invite the visitors – contributors – of this platform to consider the proposed set of scenarios, identify decisive issues that require close attention of decision-makers and consider the R&amp;I policy implications of these issues.</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br><strong>1</strong> The OECD considers just one type of multi-track world, composed of several “clusters” that is, groups – of countries, which follow their own track (path of development). These countries are not necessarily located in the same region, that is why they compose clusters, as opposed to world regions.<br><strong>2</strong> https://search.oecd.org/economy/global-scenarios-2035-df7ebc33-en.htm We use ‘multipolar’ and ‘multi-track’ scenarios as synonyms in this post.<br><strong>3</strong> https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/e436b4b6-fa50-11eb-b520-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-222702137 <br><strong>4</strong> We could consider a fourth type of multipolar world, between limited co-operation and open hostility, when the “polars” – the various groups of countries – operate in a splendid isolation. In that world there is hardly any global trade, international co-operation in investment, and RTDI activities. There are no efforts to set up global governance mechanisms to tackle critical issues, and thus ‘luck’ is needed to avoid major conflicts. To keep the number of scenarios lower, however, we do not elaborate on those scenarios here.<br><strong>5</strong> https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC125994 <br><strong>6 </strong>For a recent report on RTDI activities’ contribution to EU defence, see, e.g., https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/fs_22_1045 <br><strong>7</strong> The major objective would include to explore and extract new energy sources; develop new energy production (conversion) technologies and new ways to transport and store energy; enhance energy efficiency in all user sectors; better understand the behaviour and attitudes of various types of energy users, as well as the impact pathways of different policy tools, including regulations, to better steer and nudge their energy consumption patterns.<br><strong>8</strong> We can also think of other major food exporters in other countries and continents, depending on the food items in question.<br><br></p>

While digital competencies are essential to achieving Romania’s public sector modernization goals, they are not a standalone solution. In this context, the government of Romania, assisted by the World Bank through the Technical Support Instrument (TSI), aims to develop a <strong>General Digital Competence Framework for Civil Servants</strong>. <br><br>This report if one of the outputs of the TSI project; its goal is to identify the digital competencies necessary at the intersection of Romania’s digital transformation and HRM reform agendas, laying the groundwork for a more capable and future-ready public administration. The report employs a comprehensive multi-layered analysis, incorporating:  a top-down review of national and EU strategies, policies, and regulations; a bottom-up analysis of job descriptions, focus groups, interviews, and working groups; international best practices in public sector digital competencies; and a foresight perspective to anticipate future digital skill needs. <br><br><strong>Chapter VI | Foresight: fit-for-future digital roles in the public administration</strong> describes the foresight exercise carried out by <strong>Institutul de Prospectiva</strong> and <strong>the World Bank</strong>, which was aimed at ensuring that the <strong>proposed digital competency framework will remain future-ready</strong>, enabling civil servants to navigate digital transformation, deliver citizen-centric services, and address complex policy challenges with agility and innovation. The process was meant to <strong>inform the definition of specific digital roles that are needed in the future</strong>, but also to allow the formulation of recommendations regarding the general digital competencies of public administration employees.<br><br>The foresight methodology utilized <strong>horizon scanning and scenarios</strong> (both explorative and normative), as essential tools in helping policymakers navigate uncertainty by exploring various probable and/or desirable futures. This foresight exercise focused on the <strong>year 2032, a timeframe suited for significant structural transformation in public administration</strong>, allowing for the development and maturity of complex digital systems.<br><br>In terms of process,<strong> the scenario-building process was based on an iterative consultation process</strong>. It built on inputs developed by the foresight team from Institutul de Prospectiva and was progressively refined through three online working sessions with international experts from the World Bank and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and a final in-person workshop with local experts from the public administration and the private sector in Romania.<br>The figure below provides a concise overview of the scenario-building steps.</p>
","<p>📌The<strong> Baseline Scenario “Romanian Digital Administration in 2032” provides a ‘current paradigm’ case</strong>: It takes the current Romanian strategic documents in the field of digital transformation as a starting point. It assumes that the key goals set in these<br>documents are generally met by 2032. The logic is the following: assuming Romania’s current digitalization paradigm (and<br>associated digital roles) turn out mostly as planned, what is the gap between this best-case baseline and the digital society scenarios for 2032?<br><br>📌The <strong>Context Scenario about the “Digital society in Romania in 2032” is an exploratory scenario, meaning it describes a probable future rather than one driven by a deliberate vision of a desirable future society.</strong> The core scenario integrates high-impact, high-probability trends - or drivers of change -identified in the initial horizon scanning phase. While these drivers describe the evolution of the European and global contexts, their advancement has been partially adjusted to reflect specific conditions in Romania. In addition to the core scenario, four other narratives were built around drivers of change previously identified as having high impact as well as a rather high degree of uncertainty. These new dimensions largely complement rather than challenge the core scenario.<br><br>📌The <strong>five Aspirational Scenarios 2032 describe visions regarding the digital transformation of the Romanian public administration</strong>, going beyond the trajectory set in the baseline scenario. They examine <strong>a range of potential paths/options that could contribute, individually or in various combinations, to a more ambitious and impactful digital transformation in the public administration</strong>. Each scenario revolves around a key dimension. Primarily, these dimensions emerge from Romania’s current policy discourse and strategic documents, where they are often mentioned but with limited precision or commitment. Additionally, they reflect elements of the context scenario, incorporating anticipated societal developments by 2032, as<br>well as digital trends and paradigm shifts observed in public administrations in the EU and worldwide.<br><br>A list of key digital roles follows the baseline and aspirational scenarios, outlining the expertise civil servants need to bring them to life. These roles do not distinguish between in-house and outsourced expertise, as that remains a separate decision.</p>

The conference is one of the biggest annual research conferences within the field of futures studies and foresight, and it always attracts participants from all around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year’s conference focused on questions of what futures research provides for the sustainable management of natural resources, both for water and land.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>A diverse set of keynotes and workshop sessions</em></strong></p>
<p>During both the online day and the two days of onsite sessions, participants had the opportunity to attend a variety of keynotes, paper sessions, and workshops highlighting issues of sustainability, resources, and the need for transformations in uncertain futures. For example, Professor Gianluca Brunori, University of Pisa (IT), advocated for food system transformations in times of permacrisis, Dr. Katriina Soini, Luke (FI), discussed cultural pathways for sustainable use of natural resources, Dr. Åsa Svenfelt, Linköping University (SE), talked about futures beyond consumption, while Dr. Rafael Popper, adjunct professor in both Warsaw University of Technology (PL) and University of Turku (FI) gave an insightful view into the significance and potential of the forest-based bioeconomy as illuminated by an extensive roadmap-based foresight project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conference also hosted a Millenium Project Special Session on paradoxes of work that was introduced by an onsite keynote from Jerome Glenn, CEO of the Millennium Project. The workshop session is well-documented in a newly published <a href=""https://www.utupub.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/179052/FFRC_eBook_4-2024.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y"" target=""_self"">FFRC eBook</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Launching a ‘Mosaic of Futures Studies’</em></strong></p>
<p>Another conference highlight was the launch of a new anthology of <strong>Our World of Futures Studies as a Mosaic </strong>(openly accessible in digital format at <a href=""http://bit.ly/worldasmosaic"" target=""_self"">bit.ly/worldasmosaic</a>). The book introduces approaches to futures studies and foresight from different parts of the globe, appreciating and learning from the different contexts. While explicitly claiming that it is an introduction, rather than an all-encompassing description of the field, it provides a glimpse into the diversity of the field across five different continents. To name a few examples, the book discusses the history and development of foresight in Germany, insights on anticipation initiatives in Morocco, and the state of long-term thinking in Latin American governments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Onwards to ‘25</em></strong></p>
<p>As this year’s conference concluded, attention was again turned towards the future. Planning is already underway for next year’s conference, namely <strong>Futures of Technologies: Mutual Shaping of Socio-Technical Transformations</strong>,  a celebratory 25th edition. The Futures Conference 2025 will be organized on 10-12 June 2025 onsite in Turku, Finland, and in collaboration with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. A call for papers will be available in October 2024 with a tentative deadline for abstracts 31 January 2025. Interested parties are welcome to submit papers or workshops or simply to attend the event as participants.&nbsp;</p>

The brain consists of a multitude of small nerve cells, so-called neurons. These neurons trigger a firework of electrical impulses with every subtle perception or thought. Even if these impulses are very weak, they can be measured with the help of sensitive sensors or even imitated by electrodes. These devices can be summarized under the term neurotechnologies. Will this make humans part of the machine?<br></p>
<p>Neurotechnologies are devices that can directly access, observe, analyze, modify or stimulate the human nervous system. These technologies promise significant improvements for people with diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's as well as mental illnesses or in stroke rehabilitation. However, in addition to medical applications, there are also visions of enhancing human abilities, expanding consciousness and even merging mind and machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>The prospect of enhancing human capabilities beyond natural limits raises critical questions. The long-term effects are unknown and the dangers arising from potentially discriminatory or abusive use of these technologies are great. Questions arise about the ownership of neural data, the potential for surveillance, commercial manipulation or political influence, as well as equality, inclusion and access, and even the very definition of what it means to be human. The topic underlines the need for a broad-based social discourse.<br></p>
<p>In the future dialog Re-Engineering Human Nature, these and other critical points will be discussed with an interested audience and invited experts on two panels. The first panel will deal with human rights, ethics and the safety of neurotechnologies. Afterwards, film screenings will provide impulses for the second panel on the topic of myths and visions of neurotechnologies. With experts from various disciplines, we offer a comprehensive insight into this ambivalent technology and discuss new opportunities, potential challenges and the role of art in this socially relevant field of technology. The event is a collaboration between the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT), the Ars Electronica NeuroExperience Lab, the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs (BMEIA) and the University of Art and Design Linz.</p>

<p>These are the questions posed by the Research4Futures Dynamic Argumentative Delphi survey, carried out between 6th – 18th of December 2022 by Institutul de Prospectiva, which engaged almost 950 contributors from Europe and beyond.<br><br>The disruptions explored in the survey were drawn from recent foresight work performed by the Foresight on Demand consortium on behalf of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (DG RTD), namely two projects: Foresight towards the 2nd Strategic Plan for Horizon Europe, and project S&amp;T&amp;I FOR 2050. Science, Technology and Innovation for Ecosystem Performance – Accelerating Sustainability Transitions. These projects delivered so-called foresight scenarios at the time horizon of 2040, but the scope, methodologies and final results were different.<br><br>The case studies developed in the two projects are rather extensive texts, so for a better user experience in the Research4Futures survey, these contents were clustered and significantly condensed, resulting in eleven domains, each presented in a one-page text. In the survey, each domain page was structured under three sections: <br>i) a brief description of the disruption(s) in the respective domain; where the disruptions encompass both crises and opportunities, hopes and fears;<br>ii) a set of brief future scenarios that explore different ways the disruptions might unfold and their consequences, <br>iii) a final section on implications for R&amp;I, in light of the disruptions. <br><br>The figure below showcases the way respondents assessed the importance of the EU Framework Programme for Europe’s ability to respond effectively to the potential future disruptions within each of the domains explored in the survey.</p>
","<p>Notably, respondents regard the EU Framework Programme as an important vector of the EU in addressing challenges and opportunities brought forth by future disruptions, casting an average score between 4 and 5 (on the scale from 1 to 5) with regards to all domains, with a minor exception.</p>
<p>Second, contributors to the survey view the EU Framework Programme to be of utmost relevance and importance in connection to the future of Artificial intelligence; suggesting a significant role of research and innovation in improving AI applications and establishing ethical frameworks for AI developments, in shaping the nature of human–AI collaboration. The top R&amp;I directions stemming from the survey are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI improvements for specific applications</li>
<li>The nature of AI and human intelligence</li>
<li>AI in medical applications</li>
<li>Understanding cooperation between humans and AGI systems</li>
<li>Ethical standards, AI regulatory sandboxes</li>

One of the highlights was the 'Deep Dives' segment, which explored the risks future social confrontations might pose to European R&amp;I policies. Findings from a Horizon Scanning exercise were showcased. This exercise aimed at explaining major trends in social confrontations and the factors driving change. Using a model contrasting dimensions like democratisation versus authoritarianism and private economy influence against the significance of public goods, these four potential scenarios, each a possible future for Europe, ignited a spirited discussion among participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The scenario “European Democracy Rhizome” envisions grassroots networks playing an important role in political participation. Civil society actively engages to enhance its impact on policy-making processes, striving for greater influence and embracing new forms of structured dialogue. The concept is further explored by the <a href=""https://musae.starts.eu/"" target=""_self"">Musae Starts</a> project, which was also presented later on in the workshop. it introduces an innovative Human-Centred Factory model that integrates artistic collaboration within Digital Innovation Hubs. It aims adopt a strategic approach to exponential technologies for the future of food, aiming to improve human and planetary well-being by reducing carbon footprint and rethinking the food chain.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In contrast, one of two scenarios outlining a shift towards authoritarianism, “Defending Itself Against Totalitarian Tendencies”, depicts a situation where extremists attempt to seize control within the EU, leading to an escalation of social confrontations in countries where civil rights are violated.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The other one, “The European Fortress Defending Its Borders”, portrays the EU as safeguarding itself against external infiltration attempts and striving for self-sufficiency. However, it still contends with numerous internal and external forces and groups that fuel social confrontations within European society.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The final scenario describes a development toward more consumerism and control by large tech companies. In this scenario, “Cultural hegemony through global capitalism”, almost all types of social confrontations have ended. What is more, it implies a diminishing trust between society and science. During the workshop, <a href=""http://www.reseau-prosper.org/le-reseau-prosper/quest-ce-que-le-reseau-prosper.html"" target=""_self"">PROSPER Network</a>, which unites foresight practitioners from French public research institutions and ministries, examined what could be the drivers of reciprocal trust between society and science and how trust could evolve by 2040.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the session, the audience‘s keen interest was evident as they posed insightful questions, diving deep into the nuances of social confrontations for the Green Transition. One notable intervention brought to light a pressing concern: There's a potential for the escalation of social confrontations and unrest if the green transition doesn't incorporate substantial redistributive measures. In contrast to this concern, a project that was presented, <a href=""https://criticalmaking.eu/"" target=""_blank"">Critical Making Project</a>, examined innovation processes in the marker movement with regards to social responsibility, especially in relation to gender, openness, recruitment of young people and more generally, their social responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another question emphasized the significance of ""nature justice"" in conjunction with climate justice. It's essential to recognize that some nature-based solutions might have unintended consequences, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. The workshop provided a platform for further exploration of these considerations. Presentations showcased EU-funded projects that specifically addressed these concerns, offering a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in the green transition journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inaugural Horizon Futures Watch Workshop proved to be an insightful and engaging event. The audience’s active participation particularly underscored the urgency and complexity of addressing social confrontations in the context of the green transition. The workshop highlighted the multidimensional nature of social confrontations and the complex relationship between policies and social dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

","<p>This study considers the interpenetration of criminal and lawful economic activities, with new technologies and unregulated terrains offering new opportunities for new types of interpenetration. We explore the possibility of differentiating, regulating, and controlling criminal and legal activities and markets, the level of control technically feasible and socially and economically desirable, among other relevant issues.  We analyse the following issues, among others: <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a possibility of differentiating and controlling criminal and legal markets and economic activities?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What level of control is technically feasible and (at the same time) socially and economically desirable?  </li>
<li>To some extent is it possible to establish the lawful origins of funds used in every transaction?  <br><br>The study is relevant for several reasons:</li>
<li>Crimes have wide-ranging, major impacts on the economy, society and environment, when connected to lawful economic activities.Quite often these connections (“interpenetrations”) are not detected  - or not reported for various reasons.</li>
<li>Economic hardship and crises are likely to reinforce the incentives for committing criminal economic activities.</li>
<li>New technologies might offer new opportunities for new or “refined” criminal economic activities.</li>
<li>Economic criminals are often innovative and enter unregulated terrains (e.g.,some commons, metaverse, etc.).</li>
<li>Lack of resources and skills to fight economic crime is a major hurdle.</li>

What if political representation went beyond voting rights, encouraging experience-sharing and storytelling to come up with solutions for a better future? This is where the power of foresight comes in handy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The belief in foresight’s flexibility, reaching beyond its narrow, business-driven trajectory, is a major component of <a href=""https://www.futures4europe.eu/project/euarenas-vi8id"" target=""_blank""><strong>EUARENAS</strong></a> , a Horizon 2020-funded project investigating cities in 4 European countries (Poland, Italy, Hungary, and Estonia) as arenas for strengthening engagement and participation in democracy whilst creating momentum for political change through more inclusive and participatory forms of governance. The project  stretches foresight techniques beyond their official settings to involve various actors active within cities, including local politicians, civil servants, NGOs, activists, grassroots communities, citizen power advocacy groups for underrepresented citizens and citizens themselves, with particular attention to marginalized groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hayley Trowbridge is the CEO at People’s Voice Media, the UK-based civil society charity leading the foresight work package in the EUARENAS project. In her words, <strong><em>“EUARENAS stretched and ‘innovated’ foresight techniques and future thinking tools to blend them with participatory and collaborative research methods.”</em></strong></p>
<p>The overarching goal of this approach is to bring citizens and decision-makers together to identify problems (and solutions) concerning shared futures. Foresight approaches can support this aim, nurturing active citizenship in defining social agendas and shaping political life. Foresight can become both a tool for understanding emerging democratic innovations and for engaging citizens and other actors in such innovations.</p>
<p><strong>EUARENAS’ foresight ‘blend’</strong></p>
<p>EUARENAS’ employment of foresight follows three main methodological streams: media discourse analysis (considering traditional media); Community Reporting from scenarios of lived experience (peer-to-peer storytelling), and exploration of signals coming from social media. Results collected from these three methodologies contribute to ‘sense-making’ on the subject.</p>
<p>Firstly, the project team looked at how media discourse analysis can be used within future thinking frameworks by scanning relevant national and pan-European traditional media (TV, radio or print) products and identifying, within them, the discourses of change happening in society regarding democracy. Items (articles or broadcasts) gathered were shared in a series of local participatory workshops, organized with citizen groups that have the least voice in democracy, to support the identification of the discourses and ‘make sense’ of signals of change in society about democracy: “<em>What made this go beyond the ‘standard’ horizon scanning techniques or discourse analysis in the traditional sense”, considered Trowbridge, “was that it was framed around involving marginalized citizen groups within sense-making efforts.”</em>[1]</p>
<p>Subsequently, the EUARENAS team tested the lived experience of citizens in thinking about the future via guided peer-to-peer storytelling about their engagement in democracy and decision-making within the cities of Gdansk, Voru and Reggio Emilia. The storytelling set the basis for mapping seeds of change into possible horizons that stimulated conversations about the future[2] using the Three Horizons framework.</p>
<p>The project’s third foresight angle, perhaps the most innovative one, looked at social media as a window into current debates, social issues, and trending community topics. Social media accounts, particularly those associated with civil society and social movements showcase what issues and debates matter to people the most and offer a glimpse of emerging trends in the social sphere mediated by collective intelligence. Such content can help to hypothesise about our future, combining signals from social media with future-thinking activities by engaging experts from across policy, practice, research and academia in co-analysing conversations about the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach[3] was initially devised to examine the topic of <em>‘the future of democracy’</em>, but it can easily be adapted to support future-thinking activities on a range of topics, using social media as the core source material.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and opportunities facing EUARENAS</strong></p>
<p>One of the trickiest challenges identified by Trowbridge is the difficulty in recruiting people, allowing for equitable participation by overcoming barriers preventing people from physically ‘taking part’, such as work constraints, childcare needs, language barriers, technology competence, etc. Although EUARENAS put in place strategies to overcome these obstacles in its workshops, Trowbridge saves the story of the problematic role of financial participation incentives for another day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another big challenge to involving citizens is that dreaming about the future can sound like a privilege to people who are living a bleak present: <em>“When you're not comfortable and don’t have a ‘good’ place within society, the ability to dream and hope for better is hard without it being linked to tangible change,”</em> Trowbridge says.</p>
<p>Foresight can become a  space  in which ‘dreaming’ is not a privilege of think tanks and researchers. <a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/steapp/sites/steapp/files/2020_04_geoff_mulgan_swp.pdf"" target=""_blank""> Geoff Mulgan</a>  (2020) defined <em>‘social immagination’</em> as, a space in which <em>“communities can, once again, become heroes of their own history”</em>. In this sense, Trowbridge believes foresight has a role to play in achieving social, epistemic and economic justice, also by <em>“enabling people to go beyond ‘democracy equals electoral representation’ and thrive in true democratic engagement.” </em></p>
<p><strong>Fast-forwarding democracy: weak signals and desiderata </strong></p>
<p>When asked to reach for her crystal ball, Trowbridge has a clear picture in mind: “<em>It’s clear that the ‘business as usual’ attitude won’t suffice to face matters such as climate change and planetary health. However, we are reassured by some weak signals for change we have observed from our research in and beyond this project.”</em> Above all, people are acknowledging the complex and uncertain times we are living in and there is a shift to increased involvement in civic life.</p>
<p><em>“To embrace and address this uncertainty”</em> - Trowbridge observes – <em>“we need our services, institutions and policies to be suitable for that adaptable and uncertain environment; this means promoting a more nuanced approach to politics and deliberation…Coming to terms with the shades of grey within consensus building that allow for multiple perspectives in understanding the way(s) forward.”</em></p>
<p>We couldn’t leave Trowbridge without asking her our 1-million-dollar foresight question: If things go well, how do you expect democracy and citizen engagement to develop in the next 20 years?</p>
<p><em>“I would expect us to move away from our current rigid, hierarchical system to a more networked democracy that devolves and disperses decision-making so that decision-making happens closer to whom that decision affects.” </em></p>

The two coordinators of the Horizon 2020 European IP Institutes Network Innovation Society project (EIPIN-Innovation Society), completed in 2021, point to global trends and highlight how emerging challenges for IP regulation and innovation management are already on the table.</p>
","<p><strong>The educated guess on AI-generated innovation </strong></p>
<p>The EU's wish to lead AI regulation is explicit. “The AI Act under discussion aims to broadly regulate text and data mining initiatives, addressing societal concerns such as security, trust, and privacy”, Kamperman Sanders observes. Legitimising the complex regulatory  landscape could foster a favorable business environment for AI innovation development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conversely, an overregulation scenario could lead Europe to miss out on AI benefits by not allowing  sufficient exceptions for its ongoing development. For Moerland, the questions might be: “How far will we allow the use of training data for AI-machine learning which  may provide solutions to technical problems?” This opens a procedural dilemma: is IP the right tool to handle and manage AI-generated inventions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The persistence of legal uncertainty in the field of AI may threaten future knowledge disclosure tied to innovations. Moerland notes how, IP-wise, AI developers are potentially resorting to the use of trade secrets to regulate their technologies. The proprietary  operational mode of many AI applications and their lack of transparency contribute to the ‘black box’ effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the employment of AI and the challenge to classify its outcomes are shaking the essence of intellectual property, questioning the notions of human creativity and artistic expression that have defined it until now. The ethical value attributed to human involvement in this field will be significant in developing a system able to incentivise and reward producers of AI-generated outputs (and create a market for these contents/products) without losing sight of human developments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The potential of AI to be an enabler for further human inventiveness and creativity is a valid argument, but Kamperman Sanders wonders: “Can a human being still compete with machines that only need electricity and a prompt to produce images in the style of famous painters?”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The multiple threats of power concentration</strong></p>
<p>Kamperman Sanders feels the <a href=""https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/world-economic-and-social-survey-2018-frontier-technologies-for-sustainable-development/"" target=""undefined"">UN’s WESS report</a> from 2018 is still an interesting read in terms of the risks it flagged on possible future inequalities and power concentrations in the digital domain. In this respect, the building of portfolios of IP concentration by platform economy giants must be closely monitored. Major platform-owning companies are registering patents for AI-related services and products (i.e., from drone delivery to automated driving systems; from AI home assistants to the digitalisation of agriculture).  “Allowing platforms to accumulate such an enormous amount of market power is one of the shortcomings of IP policy (and Competition Law) in the past 10/20 years”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their collection of IP assets, paired with access to a wide range of data retrieved through platforms‘ daily operations, positions big tech companies at the top of the digital chain. A concentration of power that translates into a geopolitical dominance of USA-based industries harvesting and processing information: “With most server farms crunching data located on the US and Chinese soils, powered by local energy supplies, it becomes ‘physically’ challenging for the European hub to play a leading role in this new digital economy”.</p>
<p>Not addressing power imbalances, including through IP regulation, and relying on post-facto fixes with Competition Law might lead to a bifurcated, less globalized world. Recent focus in IP has been on unilateral measures and export restrictions, especially in high-tech and sensitive production areas like semiconductor chips. This approach may hinder the import and export of technology essential for tackling climate change and hamper broad access to the benefits of the fourth industrial revolution, as highlighted by Kamperman Sanders. Consequently, the WTO's goal of technology transfer to developing nations and lower global trade tariffs remains largely unachieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The demise of the WTO and the future of dispute settlements</strong></p>
<p>The waning power of the WTO as a rule-based forum for trade is a concern for both Kamperman Sanders and Moerland. The presence of an entitled body supervising dispute settlements is critical for the future. “The whole dispute resolution system overseen by the WTO is frozen due to the fact that the USA blocks the appointment of judges”, Kamperman Sanders considers. “The sidelining of the WTO has led to ad-hoc, shady solutions for dispute settlement resolutions which are often not in the interest of IP and innovation regulation, both from a state and a public society perspective”, Moerland underlines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>The ’right’ to circularity</strong></p>
<p>There is no looking at the future without an eye for sustainability and the circular economy. “There is a very broad spectrum of tools on IP law that could be used for the benefit of circular economy goals and this is a priority area for the European Commission to work on”, comments Moerland. “Pillars of the circular economy such as the right to repair and the eco-design approach are blind spots in IP regulation” - Kamperman Sanders declares – “We only see sector-specific regulation in relation to eco-design and the circular economy”. Promoting the patenting of ecological manufacturing processes through policy awareness and support mechanisms for the diffusion of this technology is where IP law can make a concrete contribution to the circular economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Europe has the potential to take a leading role in setting eco-design standards for product development, similar to its past role in ICT (e.g., GSM technologies), also by creating standard essential technologies that can be licensed to companies to promote circular product design and energy-efficient production, including repairability options for users and consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IP in service of society</strong></p>
<p>Attention to consumers, end users and society leads back to the ultimate purpose of intellectual property. Historically, IP rights have evolved largely through rights holders' lobbying for exclusive entitlements to protect their works or inventions. Kamperman Sanders cautions on the use of this ‘privilege’: “achievements in innovation must always serve the interest of society and societal interests must always prevail over those of the individual right holder”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concretely, IP law works towards the public interest by recognising limitations and exceptions to individual rights over inventions and technologies able to safeguard and improve social well-being. This includes ensuring that stakeholders, like governments, who contribute capital to developing technical solutions, can fully benefit from them, particularly when the technology's widespread use is crucial for human survival, such as climate mitigation tools and drug development.</p>

The roles and responsibilities of teachers have seen significant changes over the past decade. Education, childhood, labour markets and society as a whole have experienced considerable changes, prompting the need to think about the effects of changes on the teaching profession. The OECD Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) project on New Professionalism and the Future of Teaching project researched how professionalism has evolved, including the importance of working with others to confront increasingly complex contexts, so called “connective professionalism”. Based on the evidence base and ideas for next practice, the project developed a methodology to help diverse stakeholders in education to construct a shared vision on what the teaching profession could look like in the future.<br><br>This study in Wales (United Kingdom) is the second in a series of three education system studies conducted in 2023 and 2024. Various stakeholders, including teachers, school leaders, researchers, teacher educators, teacher unions, and professionals (potentially) supporting teachers and schools provided feedback on their ambitions for the future of teaching in Wales. Choosing among a set of ambitions to better connect teachers with other professionals within the school community, other education providers (such as universities and teacher education colleges) and broader society, they shared their judgements of what would be high priority and also how big a change this would be from the current context. Would it be an ambition for transformation over a period of many years? Or would it be possible to build on existing mechanisms or initiatives? Or could this ambition be achieved by improvements over the short term?<br><br>Different perspectives were gathered in two main ways. First, via an online survey. Second, via two stakeholder workshops in Bangor and Cardiff where a total of six working groups collectively constructed scenarios for the future of teaching. Each working group comprised individuals with different roles and responsibilities in or around schools. They worked with the results of the survey and selected priority ambitions to support their vision on the future of teaching. These provided stimulus for their discussions, but their specific visions grew out of a mutual exchange of professional experiences from different perspectives within and surrounding teaching in Wales.<br><br>Of course, this study in no way aims to be representative or comprehensive. It draws on the work of a group of willing professionals with a stake in Wales education who offered to share their expertise. This initial effort to anticipate and increase deeper, structured thinking about medium- and long-term scenarios for teacher professionalism and empowerment offers input on how to strengthen the teaching profession in Wales. Potential benefits for the system include long-term strategic thinking regarding the Welsh teacher workforce and finding solutions to issues that transcend the short term.<br><br>While constructing their scenarios for the future of teaching, stakeholders reflected on four research questions set for this study by the team at Welsh Government in consultation with the OECD.</p>
","<p><strong>How do we develop teacher professional identity and a more collaborative profession? </strong>The set of future scenarios envisage a focus on collective professional identity at a school level. There would be particular focuses on peer-to-peer interactions as well as school-to-school exchanges. Time and space would be provided to support a variety of exploration that involves building innovations, following passions and interests, engaging in shared learning, working with colleagues, communities and other partners.<br><br><strong>How could a career development perspective for all staff in schools contribute to a vibrant and thriving workforce?</strong> Career development would be an integral focus to support the workforce. This would include visible and diverse career pathways that follow and invest in career journeys. Teachers would be supported to engage in their own professional growth journey and collaborations that enrich their professional work. Career pathways would allow for flexibility and lifelong learning opportunities that support a dynamic workforce.<br><br><strong>How can all who work in schools encourage innovation and the examination of professional roles in schools as learning organisations?</strong> Valuing innovative practices requires alignment at all levels to define what innovation looks like at a school level. This includes strengthening collaborative practices that support reflection, experimentation, partnering and sharing. Support includes time and space to work as part of a professional community. It is important to build connections across innovations to reduce duplication of effort and to maximise shared learning.<br><br><strong>And how could investment in the professional identity of teachers, especially in secondary schools, make the profession in those settings more attractive? </strong>Teachers should be able to align their intrinsic motivation to their teaching, keeping their practice closer to their professional interests and qualities, and having a sense of autonomy in their work. Investing in continuous, bespoke support and professional development enhances teacher well-being, strengthens their professional identity, and makes the teaching profession more attractive and rewarding. Meaningful development opportunities, recognition, and leadership roles enhances the profession’s appeal and fosters long-term commitment.<br><br>The OECD identified seven key elements that feature across a set of four preferred future scenarios for the future of teaching in Wales. Arguably, all would be important to the future of teaching and many are common to several of the scenarios. In particular, diverse professional roles and careers, healthy working environment, school leadership, community support/ partnerships, school-university partnerships, innovation and communication feature to some extent across all four scenarios. Governance and accountability were explicitly featured in three scenarios.<br><br>The study also underlines the importance of thinking in more nuanced ways about the existing teacher workforce and potential new recruits. There is a rich diversity of professionals working within schools in Wales, with different motivations, life phases, passions, ambitions and professional development needs. An evidence-informed set of seven Welsh teacher personas provides input to stress test the set of future scenarios. What would different teachers find attractive in the future scenarios that were developed? Would it be particularly attractive to experienced teachers? Would newer recruits hold some reservations? Would it match what younger people will be looking for in their working lives? Overall, the Welsh teacher personas responded positively to the suggested scenarios for the teaching profession in Wales.<br><br>This report presents results of the initial reflection and provides tools to extend the exercise going forward.</p>

An important challenge for the coming years is accelerating up- and reskilling so that people have the green skills to thrive in greener jobs.<br><br>In this workshop, we seek to develop scenarios for the future of green skills and jobs. The series is part of the ""European R&amp;I foresight and public engagement for Horizon Europe"" project. It supports the work of the Horizon Europe Foresight Network and provides intelligence and supports the development of a European R&amp;I foresight community.</p>

","<p><em>The worskhop was relized on 14th of April, 2025 at MOMus- Museum of Modern Art, Thessaloniki, Greece  </em></p>
<p><br><strong><em>Context</em></strong><br>Have you ever wondered why people in Ancient Egypt (3100-30 BCE) wore hair wigs? Or why samurai have been associated with kimonos, while feminine full skirts are linked with the post-war America of the ‘50s? There are numerous examples of fashion items that represent specific periods and places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what does that signify? <br>In ancient Egypt, men wearing hair wigs was considered an honor and a symbol of equalization to women, as women were regarded as wise and sacred.  Similarly, in Tokugawa Japan (1603 – 1868), when samurai lived, clothing indicated one’s rank and role within the highly structured feudal society, while in post-war America, fashion was influenced by the idealized image of the suburban family, emphasizing domesticity and traditional gender roles.<br>The common space of all three examples is that - throughout the centuries - fashion has served people and societies as a way of self-expression, a sign of social status, also revealing the prevailing social norms and beliefs. <br><br>Today, our highly complex and uncertain world requires strategic tools that will help us create new sustainable development trajectories. Fashion not only reveals unique and collective identities, norms, and ethics but is also associated with environmental issues. It is one of the largest pollutant industries, prompting a shift in the way we produce and consume fashion items. How might the climate crisis change our attitudes, and how does this impact the fashion industry? <br><br><br><strong><em>What is Fashion Futuring?</em></strong><br>Fashion Futuring is an innovative approach that investigates potential links among objects, fiction, culture, and systems to understand how the values of the systems/societies can shape the future of fashion. It suggests a significant shift in the future of fashion approach, moving away from short-term trends and financial forecasting as primary factors for fashion production, towards sustainable, more humane means of fashion producing and consuming. <br><br><br><strong><em>The pilot</em></strong><br>The upcoming pilot in April is targeted towards domain experts in fashion &amp; foresight. The workshop consists of a 7-stage methodology based on Garcia (2023), where participants will be encouraged to share their personal experiences and values, co-create a fictional future, and work together to design a fictional fashion item based on this future. The workshop will utilize various foresight methods, primarily core design, what-if scenario development, and strategic thinking.</p>
<p>That will be the second pilot in Fashion Futuring implemented by Helenos. The first pilot was held in January 2025 in Thessaloniki, involving local citizens. This upcoming workshop aims to contribute to a collective knowledge pool, helping to create a comprehensive understanding of the future of fashion and sustainability.</p>
<p><br>This workshop will be implemented in English.</p>

What does the future look like for R&I in Europe? How does foresight play a role? Radu provides a glimpse into these questions and Eye of Europe’s central role in them.</p>","<p><strong>Can you encapsulate the essence of the </strong><a href=""https://www.futures4europe.eu/projects/eye-of-europe-the-research-and-innovation-foresight-community"" target=""_self""><strong>Eye of Europe project</strong></a><strong> in a metaphor?</strong></p>
<p>I would say it’s a dream machine, a space where we collectively weave our dreams and our aspirations regarding potential futures. More pragmatically, it is an attempt to build a social infrastructure for piecing together existing conversations in foresight and amplifying them to create synergies. People make up the heart of this project, not just foresight practitioners but anyone who is intrigued by the future of their domains of expertise, as well as non-expert audiences. These individuals, representing a wide spectrum of interests, can dive into foresight projects, outputs, interesting scenarios, visions, and disruptive trends, to name a few. Our platform, <a href=""http://futures4europe.eu/"" target=""undefined"">Futures4Europe</a>, serves as a hub for this vibrant community, keeping the conversation about our collective future alive and enabling participants to learn from one process to another. This interaction doesn’t just stay online. It extends into the physical world through foresight exercises, futures literacy workshops, mutual learning exercises, and conferences. It’s all about creating a continuous loop of dialogue, learning and inspiration.<br><br><strong>If you could solve one major challenge for Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) in Europe with a snap of your fingers, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>I would re-imagine R&amp;I not just as a field in its own right, but as a beacon of transformation across all sectors. Despite considerable efforts, R&amp;I still struggles to truly integrate with other areas. I would like to see R&amp;I at the heart of policy-making across diverse fields like energy, or food, or any other policy domain, as a foundational element. I think that research offers so much more than just generic evidence; it provides a deeper understanding of our society, its context, and a reflection about where we are and what we want. In essence, I would reposition R&amp;I, and especially foresight-empowered R&amp;I, to be at the forefront of policy development, facilitating new understandings and paving the way towards positive change.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond metrics and milestones, how do you hope that this project will change the conversation around R&amp;I in Europe?</strong></p>
<p>One of the aims is to support institutionalisation of foresight in R&amp;I. This means encouraging R&amp;I funding agencies to incorporate foresight procedures and capabilities in support of their strategic planning. Given that research and its funding navigate future possibilities and uncertainties, adopting a structured foresight approach is crucial. Institutionalising foresight in R&amp;I funding agencies should become the norm in the following decade.</p>
<p>Beyond institutional practices, our ambition extends to cultivating a more inclusive dialogue about the future within the R&amp;I community. While domain experts often contribute to these future focussed discussions, their engagement remains sporadic. EYE of Europe seeks to change this, maintaining an open, continuous conversation where everyone’s insights are valued and leveraged. We want to create that spark and keep the fire going.<br><br><strong>If you had to look into your crystal ball, what will R&amp;I look like in Europe in 10 years?</strong></p>
<p>I see AI emerging as the cornerstone of transformation in R&amp;I. The speed at which research can progress, thanks to AI, is both a gamechanger and a complex challenge. We already face scientific papers published without or with little human help, and this triggers ethical debates. I see this only as an early sign of the tsunami: AI can reshape the face of research by becoming not only a very powerful tool, but also a partner in innovation. The challenge and opportunity to harness AI responsibly and creatively in research is an open invitation to the entire European R&amp;I community. The future of R&amp;I in Europe, enriched and transformed by AI, promises to be both exciting and complicated, demanding our attention, imagination, and ethical consideration.</p>

However, circular economy or sustainability practices are not often seen as competitive advantages for companies. The ConnectedFactories project focussed on devising potential pathways to digital manufacturing, including circular economy from a broader perspective.</p>","<p>The ConnectedFactories project investigated how manufacturing systems and processes can become digitally integrated and work seamlessly together. It uncovered crucial factors and tools that can make this integration possible. In addition, ConnectedFactories connected different projects and their outcomes, practical examples, and demonstrations to the strategies and important factors identified. The project has been initiated by EFFRA, the European Factories of the Future Research Association.</p>
<p>The ConnectedFactories consortium also figured out what factories need now and in the future, as well as the problems they might face across different <a href=""https://www.connectedfactories.eu/pathways-digitalisation-manufacturing"" target=""undefined"">pathways</a> and the importance of cross-cutting factors, such as interoperability or legal aspects. It was a project composed of two phases, namely Connected Factories 1 (running from 2016-2019) and Connected Factories 2 (2019-2021). The first project focussed on three pathways, namely smart autonomous factories, hyperconnected factories, and collaborative product-service factories. The second project added pathways on circular economy, cybersecurity, data spaces, and AI.</p>
<p>“In the first level of the smart autonomous pathway, for example, many companies utilise spreadsheets for data management. But to optimise data gathering and processing practices, one needs more advanced solutions and dedicated software platforms,” says Chris Decubber, who coordinated the first effort of the project and supported Connected Factories 2. “As soon as companies can establish more dedicated data processing, they can use that data to improve their manufacturing processes, in some cases even consider automated interaction between the data analytics side and the actual operation of the processes supported by real-time decision making.” These pathways thus describe the structured progression toward achieving advanced levels of digitalisation of manufacturing.</p>
<p>Among the pathways explored, the <a href=""https://www.connectedfactories.eu/circular-economy-pathway"" target=""undefined"">Circular Economy pathway</a> was devised to emphasise the importance of circularity for sustainable manufacturing, encouraging companies to embrace this approach. However, often, SMEs find it difficult to invest in new circular approaches and supporting technologies while focussing on growing their business through finding new customers, partners and developing new products. “You clearly have a lot of inspiring approaches and technologies out there, but if nobody knows about them or knows how to use them, then there is no point,” says Decubber. “Additionally, if the management does not have a clear insight in the economic viability and a clear indication that these technologies will make a difference, they won’t be introduced, regardless of whether operators know how to use them or not. And that is also an important aspect to be considered.”</p>
<p>ConnectedFactories developed a <a href=""https://portal.effra.eu/results/list/result?result_search%5BtextQuery%5D=human+digital&result_search%5Btype%5D=All&result_search%5Bcalltopic%5D=&result_search%5Bcall%5D=&result_search%5Bprogramme%5D=&result_search%5Bproject%5D=&result_search%5Bsort%5D=Relevancy&result_search%5BsortDirection%5D=Descending&result_search%5Bpublishable%5D=1"" target=""undefined"">pathway</a> to help companies understand where companies stand in relation to the Circular Economy and where they can improve. It assesses different aspects of their business and compares their position to an ideal one and to other companies on the same journey. Companies don't have to follow a strict, step-by-step process to reach the ideal state, but rather, the path to improvement can be flexible, especially for newcomers.</p>
<p>The CE pathway starts with companies operating in a linear manner, where they meet environmental regulations but do not view CE and sustainability as strategic advantages (level 1). Many companies then move on to piloting initiatives to reduce energy and material inputs, often driven by a desire to enhance their brand image (level 2).</p>
<p>A significant step towards more sustainable manufacturing involves systemic resource management, where data from various sources is used systematically to improve resource efficiency and circularity (level 3). Moving to the next level of CE thinking, companies collaborate with their value chains to explore environmental, social, and economic sustainability aspects. This network-level activity is crucial for fully embracing the Circular Economy (level 4). The most advanced phase is ideal circularity, where companies and their value chains are restructured to create closed or cross-sectoral value loops. In this phase, data flows and data spaces play a crucial role in highlighting the positive sustainability impacts (level 5).</p>
<p>This pathway has clear implications for the kinds of skill sets required to fulfil it, and the cross-cutting factors on human skills demonstrate this. From linearity, which demands simple tasks such as recycling and other environmental obligations, more strategic thinking is found in subsequent levels. Strategies aiming towards resource sufficiency, such as disassembly, require a product lifecycle manager to look at the whole supply chain, rather than just the product. More advanced levels would incorporate servitisation, thereby focusing on the customer service experience to help customers choose resource-efficient options, and industrial symbiosis to maximise exchange of resources and materials across industrial actors.</p>
<p>Walking through an example that illustrates the challenges of circularity in the (re--manufacturing context, Decubber considers the manufacturing of electric motors. “While there are ongoing advancements in disassembling, reusing, and recycling them, a crucial question arises: how do we handle the disassembly process, and can automation play a role in it? When we're dealing with thousands of engines being repurposed for a second life, it's likely that a combination of manual labour and automation will be necessary. However, this raises another important question: were these engines originally designed with disassembly in mind? In this scenario, the entire maintenance or remanufacturing process must undergo a comprehensive redesign. We need to determine which tasks can be automated and which ones require human intervention, all while ensuring that the engines are designed to facilitate the disassembly process effectively.”</p>
<p>The challenge boils down to the product itself, as often the products that are being put on the market were not originally designed for disassembly. SMEs will therefore have to assess the entire product value chain to understand the critical processes and skill requirements needed to be on the path headed towards a circular economy.</p>

Petranka also leads the work on long-term thinking, supporting Wales’ public sector organisations to increase capabilities, skills and balancing short-term urgent issues without compromising the well-being of people living in the future. <br><br>Petranka will address the role of “Collective Intelligence” in Foresight for Research and Innovation Policy at the upcoming </em><a href=""https://www.futures4europe.eu/post/eye-of-europe-conference-foresight-and-ri-wjyxd"" target=""_blank""><em>Futures4Europe Conference 2025</em></a><em>, held in Vienna on the 15-16 May 2025.</em><br></p>
","<p><strong>What is the Future Generations Act and how do you apply it in your daily work?</strong><br>The Futures Generations Act places a legislative duty on all devolved public sector organisations in Wales, requiring them to carry out sustainable development. The legislation sets a vision for Wales in the form of seven well-being goals, including a Prosperous Wales, Resilient Wales, Thriving Welsh Language, and Globally Responsible Wales. <br><br>To help us measure if we are achieving the seven well-being goals, the Welsh Government has set 50 National Indicators and 16 milestones. Interestingly, none of them use GDP as a measure of well-being. Instead, our national indicators focus on aspects like healthy habits, access to housing, and other community-shaping elements. Additionally, we have five ways of working to help us achieve this vision: long term thinking, prevention, integration, collaboration, and involvement of those affected by decisions. <br><br>It is part of Public Bodies’ duty in Wales to take account of these ways of working when making any decision, which may impact future generations. Progress is tracked through the annual <a href=""https://www.gov.wales/wellbeing-wales-2024"" target=""_blank"">Wellbeing report</a>, with indicators reviewed every three years. <br><br><strong>Wales is the only country in the world with a Future Generations Act. Why do you think this is and how do you think other countries can be persuaded to follow suit? </strong><br>Wales has always had a strong commitment to sustainability and forward-thinking governance. Being a small nation, it is agile enough to effectively pilot innovative approaches for change. Having benefited from a period of relative political continuity, it has laid the groundwork for long term planning, which can be challenging in many countries due to the short-term nature of political cycles. A perfect storm of events, including increasing concerns about environmental protections and spending constraints, led to the national ‘Wales We Want’ conversation, and, ultimately, to the Well-Being of Future Generations Act. There has been a strong interest in this model, and we try to collaborate with countries such as Ireland and Scotland, and even as far as India, who work towards drafting their own future generation bills. There is also the <a href=""https://ourfuturegenerations.com"" target=""_blank"">Network of Institutions and leaders for Future Generations (NIFG</a>), which is a cross-country collaboration. It includes representat ives and leaders from different countries that are involved in trying to pass future generation bills. <br><br>Wales faces some uncommon challenges like the complexity of devolution, with some powers and areas sitting with the Welsh Government, while others remain reserved to the UK Government. We also face issues common to most countries, such as short-term political cycles and short-term budgets. Because Wales is a small country, it often faces challenges when it comes to skills to address these bigger issues. But being small is also a benefit, for example when it comes to collaboration. There is a lot of ambition to lead the way, as people here feel very strongly about what is happening in their country.<br><br><strong>How do you implement futures thinking when taking into account the wellbeing of young people in Wales?</strong><br>While the Act is about intergenerational justice, it is also about addressing a democratic deficit that arises from decision-making today impacting generations tomorrow. These future generations are not yet born, but will experience the long term impacts of our decisions later on. We therefore need to provide a voice for them not only by incorporating their perspective, but also ensuring that there is a chair at the table for them. <br><br><strong>What methods do you use to imagine a voice for the people who are not yet born?</strong><br>There are many foresight techniques and creative methodologies we can use. The key is to involve intergenerational, diverse, and cultural perspectives, especially from younger generations. In one of our projects, we asked: ‘How will climate change impact inequalities for future generations?’ We worked with foresight practitioners and literature professors specialising in storytelling and sci-fi, using techniques that enabled people to imagine  characters from the future and bring them to life. This led to a story book and a practical methodology.<br><br>The most important part is sparking people’s imagination, especially in the public sector. Storytelling connects on a deeper level - if data and evidence alone had worked, we would have solved things like climate change by now. Storytelling enables you to imagine your family, your community in the future; it becomes real. I also find that starting from a shared hope, such as wanting our children to lead healthier and fuller lives, a common ground is created, leading to more meaningful and positive conversations.<br><br><strong>If you look 30 years into the future, what do you think will  be the most pressing issue for young people to tackle and how can it be addressed now?</strong><br>Many issues today - from climate change, ageing population, civic disengagement, collapsing food systems, health crises, are already shaping the next 30 years. How we prioritise these aspects depends on who you ask, but what’s crucial is recognising their interconnection. Climate change, for example, impacts food security, health, and beyond. Separating them in silos prevents us from seeing them as all part of a collective system. The good news is that the future is not fixed; how we respond to these megatrends is still within our control. We are shaping the future right now and that uncertainty can not only be a risk, but also an opportunity - and that can be empowering. <br><br><strong>Looking into what we can do now, what projects are you working on today that build towards this mission? </strong><br>We’re currently working on the Future Generations Report, which is published every five years. It will assess how public bodies in Wales are progressing with the goals of the Well-being of Future Generations Act and offer recommendations for moving forward. The report will highlight key learnings, ongoing challenges, and areas where we believe more action is needed. It’s set to be released in late April. As part of this work, we’re also developing training sessions and school modules on futures thinking and foresight to support more people in Wales  in building long-term capacity.<br></p>

","<p>If the keyword in the use of land, from the 18th century onwards, was ‘urbanisation’, concentrating on industrialisation and city expansion, the current environmental challenges, including food security and carbon emissions, make a strong case for ‘ruralisation’. <br>Sustained and long-term efforts to foster the regeneration of rural areas in Europe should take the stage to rebalance soil protection, shift economic activities to rural areas to safeguard local food supply chains and cater for the loss of biodiversity which is bound to negatively impact planetary health. <br>Inverting the urban-centric trend requires re-thinking land use and identifying strategic issues that contribute to lowering pressure on cities, repopulate rural areas with new generations of farmers, and ensure the sustainability of the whole process. Behind the Horizon 2020 RURALIZATION initiative is the desire to make rural areas more appealing to new generations of farmers and inhabitants.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Embracing rural futures</strong></p>
<p>A true rural regeneration is only possible if issues such as limited choice of services, fewer job opportunities and isolation due to poor connections are properly addressed.</p>
<p>However, before diving into the improvement of the quality of life in rural areas, <strong>Professor Willem Korthals Altes</strong>, coordinator of the RURALIZATION project has no doubts: <em>“Access to land is one of the key widespread barriers to entering farming as land ownership is largely concentrated in large companies or long-standing family businesses, driving away rural newcomers.”</em></p>
<p>As a Professor in Land Development at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment of the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands, Korthals Altes is an expert in governance of land development and a connoisseur of the legal complexities of modern land use.</p>
<p>To get young generations on the fields, running small farms (with an eye to sustainable agricultural practices), and replacing retiring farmers, the land must be accessible! This is why RURALIZATION has not only united research organisations in rural policy brainstorming but also members of the Access to Land network, to formulate solutions and recommendations responding to the diverse needs and features of rural areas in Europe.</p>
<p>RURALIZATION’s efforts towards promoting a constructive dialogue between actors from all levels of the agriculture chain around the allocation and use of land has led to a tangible result: a Handbook intended to support local authorities in ‘regenerating’ their rural areas. It offers ideas, tools, and field-based examples to inspire and enable local authorities to take action across Europe to protect farmland and make it work for the public good.</p>
<p>To inform a forward-looking policy able to facilitate the settlement of new rural generations, RURALIZATION makes use of foresight. Foresight analysis was first employed to identify, through an exploratory analysis of megatrends, trends and weak signals, a large set of inclinations potentially having an impact on rural regeneration in thinking about rural futures. To better understand what the expectations are for a location to qualify as a ‘dream area’ and what kinds of people are dreaming about specific types of (rural) areas, an inventory of future dreams among the youth was carried out in 20 regions across 10 EU countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<em>The result of asking 2,000 young people about their dream lives for the future has naturally yielded 2,000 different dreams”</em>, says Korthals Altes, <em>“but what we have noticed, in general, is that an increasing number of people hope to live more rural than where they are living now.”</em> To turn these rural dreams into reality it is central to build both an accessible system for young people to make their income in rural activities as well as provide the infrastructure for them to have the desired quality of life in a non-urban context. In this respect, bucolic coastal areas have a high development potential and can provide a whole range of attractive socio-economic opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Land access, farming and stewardship: informing policy to paint rural futures</strong></p>
<p>These foresight methodologies allowed RURALIZATION to develop a potentials matrix as a synthesis of the assessment process of rural trends and dreams. This output may serve as a benchmarking tool for a high-level vision of what is considered beneficial by stakeholders, experts and researchers in various types of rural settings. Local applications of foresight tools such as the potentials matrix may support European, national, regional and local actors in their assessments of alternative futures for their rural regions.</p>
<p>How these futures will look depends on the course that governance of land and nature will take: <em>“As land and nature are clearly also important investment goods, funds and environmental values are not always aligned”</em>, notes Korthals Altes, <em>“but if you want to protect nature you must take action not only in terms of regulating land allocation but also in terms of shaping the ‘marketing’ of how land will be managed by people in an environmentally-conscious manner.”</em> Within the wider rural scenario, special attention should go to making a wiser use of coastal areas, promoting activities such as aquaculture production or the restoration of coastal wetlands.</p>
<p><em>“Most EU agricultural policy is still guided by 1950s ideals which don’t take into account the current soil health scenarios and the fact that, to meet Green Deal objectives, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has to be re-structured to cater for an agroecological management of land”</em>, says Korthals Altes. Currently, most subsidies coming from the Common Agricultural Policy are not supporting pathways for land acquisition by new farmers who are willing to engage in green developments.</p>
<p>Looking at the social agenda, there is a need to consider who is managing the soil, which groups are ‘invested’ with its stewardship and how this is passed on. Part of the structural change needed in rural settings is not only a generational one, linked to the need to replace the aging population of farmers, but also to make the agricultural system more inclusive in terms of gender balance: <em>“Land management is still a very masculine and patriarchal business, often tried to strict kinship-based structures; it’s almost impossible for people without a family-base in farming to step in”</em>,  Korthals Altes observes, <em>“We have to move into the direction of facilitating new actors in joining, with social models that reflect current times”</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Making ruralisation the norm, not the exception</strong></p>
<p>Korthals Altes is a firm believer that the future, including our agriculture and soil management, is what we make of it today, which paths humanity chooses to embark on by taking well-informed actions. A shift in people’s lifestyles towards ruralisation can be instrumental to boost sustainable agro-practices and re-balance the distribution of production, resources, and people from high-polluting urban settings to well-connected rural ones. To ‘go rural’ it is paramount to make this regulation of land ownership and access ideally integrated by innovative and participatory land policy instruments.</p>
<p>The time is ripe to invest in more sustainable and agroecological uses of land: <em>“Initiatives such as the Green Deal and the Farm to Fork are going in that direction but the scale and pace at which things are happening are worrying; too little, too slowly…”</em>. The current outcomes of nature protection actions and policies already reflect this urgency: <em>“Sure, we are seeing certain plants and animal species coming back but the negative developments still outweigh the positive ones”</em>, reckons Korthals Altes.</p>

","<p><strong>Scenario dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Strong global governance; Sustainable lifestyles; Open to risk-taking; Weak activism</p>
<p><strong>1. Impact and risk areas </strong></p>
<p>Although Europe has banded together via the European Commission as well as coordination involving coalitions of individual countries, climate change continues to ravage the continent in 2040 as global warming has reached<strong> 2oC</strong> above pre-industrial levels. <a href=""https://www.climatechangepost.com/countries/netherlands/coastal-floods/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Storm surges and flooding have inundated large parts of the Netherlands </strong></a> and other low-lying parts of Western Europe, and the Arctic parts of Russia, Norway, Finland, and Sweden continually see numerous <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252101036_Glacier_Lake_Outburst_Floods_in_Norway_2001_-_2009"" target=""_blank""><strong>glacial lake outburst floods</strong></a><strong>  and the advanced melting of permafrost</strong>, some of which have incurred billions of dollars of damages, such as the famous 2029 avalanche and resulting flood that decimated large parts of Rundvassbreen, an outlet glacier of Blåmannsisen and one from Flatbreen, an outlet glacier of Jostedalsbreen, and the permanent closure of the Trans-Siberian railway. <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/videos/weather/2022/08/17/historic-drought-dries-europe-rivers-orig-aw.cnn"" target=""_blank""><strong>Severe drought </strong></a> has also affected crops severely with Greek olive farmers, French winemakers, and Spanish vegetable growers all seeing record high rates of <strong>crop losses, fires, and unemployment</strong>.  Heat waves continue to <strong>constrain nuclear power </strong>generation in France and <strong>curtail hydroelectricity</strong> generation in Norway, Eastern Europe, and Iceland, due to unexpected melting of snowpack and seasonal alterations in river flow and precipitation patterns. For the first time ever, London faced a sever <strong>water shortage</strong> in 2039 due to unusually warm temperatures and the <a href=""https://21stcenturychallenges.org/the-thames-barrier/#:~:text=The%20barrier%20was%20originally%20designed,on%20protecting%20London%20from%20flooding"" target=""_blank"">complete draining of the Thames River</a> , which ran dry for four months.  European leaders plan to meet in 2040 to discuss a “Common Treaty for <strong>Climate Refugees</strong>,” estimated to surpass 100 million in 2035. The European Fuel Poverty Observatory also estimates than 40% of households across the continent are either in severe or chronic <a href=""https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/markets-and-consumers/energy-consumers-and-prosumers/energy-poverty_en#:~:text=guarantee%20our%20health.-,Energy%20poverty%20in%20the%20EU,the%20EU%20and%20its%20members"" target=""_blank""><strong>energy poverty</strong></a> .</p>
<p><strong>2. Practices and technologies</strong></p>
<p>Europe remains a hub of hopeful innovation and technical fixes to these challenges, with scores of notable inventions patented and commercialized over the past two decades. French biologist Jean-Luc Picard famously developed his <a href=""https://www.newstatesman.com/environment/food-farming/2022/06/world-drought-europes-farmers-heatwaves-climate"" target=""_blank""><strong>drought</strong></a><strong> resistant treatment </strong>for agricultural production in 2031, one that entered into widespread use within the sector by 2035. Artificial meat and advancements in other cultured products have buttressed large <a href=""https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/europe-over-20-now-flexitarian-number-of-vegans-doubles-according-to-new-study/#:~:text=1.,representing%203.2%25%20of%20the%20population"" target=""_blank""><strong>changes in diet</strong></a>, with 40% of Western Europe now self-identifying as either vegetarian or vegan. Six of Europe’s largest offshore wind farms as well as seventeen <strong>nuclear power </strong>plants (expected to retire in the 2020s) were instead given license<strong> extensions</strong> and now power the four largest<a href=""https://projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/en/horizon-magazine/quenching-worlds-thirst-grid-water-desalination#:~:text=Once%20only%20an%20issue%20in,connection%20to%20the%20electricity%20grid"" target=""_blank""> desalination facilities</a> in the world, supplying water to one-third of continental Europe and (via a transboundary sharing agreement) Israel. The European Space Agency also committed €1 trillion to deploy an<strong> Interplanetary </strong><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032122001046"" target=""_blank""><strong>Sun Shield</strong></a><strong> </strong>at the LaGrange Point between the Earth and Sun, with construction already occurring in high orbit and completion of a moon colony (which will provide materials, robotics, and resources for the Shield) expected to occur by 2042. The Sun Shield is competing with an American proposal to deploy a Dyson Dot also at the same La Grange point, with construction commencing in 2044. In the Mediterranean, localized deployment of <strong>cloud brightening</strong> and <strong>coastal afforestation</strong> have begun to regenerate and restore degraded seascapes and marine areas. <strong>Hydrogen</strong> has achieved widespread use within industry, and 98% of Europe’s passenger car fleet is now fully battery electric. <strong>Marine permaculture</strong>, especially <a href=""https://www.sams.ac.uk/facilities/seaweed-farms/"" target=""_blank"">seaweed farming</a>, is widespread off the coast of Scotland, Ireland, Iceland and Greenland.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Demographics, economy and governance</strong></p>
<p>Europe remains a global leader in climate governance, surpassing the United States in 2028 as President of the World Bank and becoming the premier negotiator for climate mitigation thereafter. The landmark 2031 Treaty between the <a href=""https://climate.ec.europa.eu/news-your-voice/news/joint-press-communique-following-second-eu-china-high-level-environment-and-climate-dialogue-2021-10-10_en#:~:text=In%20a%20high%2Dlevel%20meeting,between%20China%20and%20the%20EU"" target=""_blank"">EU-China</a> pledges to cut emissions by 90% by 2040, well before China’s Five-Year Plan had initially promised. In return, Europe now has 250 million <strong>Chinese migrants who work on green technology </strong>and clean industrial systems, notably solar energy, hydrogen, and batteries.  Populations in Europe have therefore begun to rise, due to the influx of immigrants and positive spillover effects of innovation. Crowdsourcing business models have begun to flourish as well, especially among<strong> </strong><a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8730528"" target=""_blank""><strong>peer-to-peer networks</strong></a><strong> and cooperatives</strong>, such as the newly formed <a href=""https://www.mondragon-corporation.com/en/about-us/"" target=""_blank"">Mondragon Energy Cooperative</a> in 2039, which now controls 24% of <a href=""https://www.energy-storage.news/the-three-things-the-us-needs-to-catch-up-with-europes-battery-gigafactory-charge/"" target=""_blank""><strong>European electricity</strong></a><strong> supply </strong>across seven countries. Innovations have not diffused equally, however, with many youths and students, those having to rent rather than own their homes, and elderly still reliant on fossil fuels or in substandard housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Life-styles and activism</strong></p>
<p>Given the severity of highly visible impacts and risk areas, climate change has become a defining local, national, and regional political issue. <a href=""https://greenparty.eu.auth0.com/login?state=hKFo2SBkME9QX3B4TVhPclVTOG91T1FKZjVNMGNpV0xZbjh6ZqFupWxvZ2luo3RpZNkgLUYxUEZ5Nld4dnl2MkpuSDk3cWlFNHJmeVlhSk11aHGjY2lk2SBsdEZxd0VSSmZINWZ5alBSTmlzRm5FYUI5djM1Q1Y5QQ&client=ltFqwERJfH5fyjPRNisFnEaB9v35CV9A&protocol=oauth2&scope=openid%20email%20profile&nonce=21760d3a6eb9e5331c78448a33e4da856e48397a56b739ed1d1d22a1f8324bd2&response_type=code&response_mode=query&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpolicyarchive.greenparty.org.uk%2Findex.php%3Fauth0%3D1"" target=""_blank""><strong>The Green Party</strong></a><strong>  is now the largest</strong> single political coalition across Western Europe, following national victories in German, Denmark, and the UK (following a disastrous 20 years of Conservative leadership). Their “Green Vision for Europe” has wide appeal across all constituencies. The election of Prime Minister Greta Thunberg to preside over the European Commission has launched<a href=""https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/socialpolicy/2019/10/28/the-greta-generation-the-rise-of-youth-activism-for-climate-change/"" target=""_blank""> a new wave</a>  of <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/stories/young-climate-activists-demand-action-inspire-hope"" target=""_blank"">youth climate activists</a>, including the very influential <strong>“Net Zero Now!”</strong> organization which has more youth subscribers than the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts combined. The 2037<a href=""https://unfccc.int/news/divestment-movement-takes-step-forward-in-eu"" target=""_blank""> Carbon Divestment Act</a> , implemented as EC.1031.121, also restricts any financial institution from investing in fossil fuels, an act that resulted in the stranding of more than $110 trillion in fossil fuel assets around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>Senior scientist at “Our World in Data” Bastian Herre gave an alarming as well as reconciling view into deterioration of liberal democracies worldwide as well as in Europe. Yet, he pointed out that most of our present democracies are built on solid institutions and that they are most likely to be resilient against internal and external attacks.</p>
<p><br>Michel Debruyne of Beweging.net introduced results from comparative country research from the INVOLVE-democracy project. Among the factors stablizing liberal democracies long-term are the quality of trust in public institutions and policies as well as making participation possible for all citizens. However, when looking at public policies and social benefits, the picture is more ambiguous: while public health expenditure is considered a stabilizing factors, high expenditure in pensions might result in distrust. More definite in destabilizing democracy in a country are corruption and low quality of public transport.</p>
<p><br>The RECLAIM project is researching the significance of expression of information disorder and democratic stability. The protection of the public sphere is identified as a cornerstone of democracy. Of similar importance are public service social media as well as a better regulation of social media companies. In his presentation Maximilian Conrad, University of Iceland, also pointed out the significance of the education factor, not only for children but also for adults, including science education and media literacy. Destabilizing factors are among other disruptive technologies, fragmented public spheres and distrust in traditional journalism and science.</p>
<p><br>In the MeDeMAP presentation by Maren Beaufort, Austrian Academy of Sciences, focused on the role of (social) media and stated that traditional information media and pluralism, thinking long-term and endorsing a culture of diversity are crucial of maintaining democratic values. Investigative journalism plays a special role as it uncovers corrupt activities and disguised the foes of democracy. What we cannot expect is a consensus in social media bubbles. Definitely destabilizing liberal democracies is the exclusion of citizens from discourses; and also the suppression of media as well as the lack of self-criticism within journalism. Still open are questions such as: How to prevent democracies die at the hands of elected leaders—who subvert the very process that brought them to power.</p>
<p><br>An outlook into diverse futures of democratic values was presented in the “Literary Quartet” where four passionate readers of science fiction literature gave their interpretation of four different novels dedicated to the longevity of democratic life in the future. What we can learn from novel like Infomocracy (2016), The Lost Cause (2023), The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), and The Ministry for the Future (2020)? The discussion extracted visions of pluralist and diverse societies where humans can change their identity, experiment with new forms of governance in local communities, where central governments are resolved and where people find ways to cope with climate change by supporting each other.<br></p>

Despite the growth of online activism, street demonstrations are as significant as ever. </p>","<p>Professor Jacquelien van Stekelenburg holds a Chair in Social Change and Conflict at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. She is Director of Research of the Department of Sociology and cochairs the Institute of Societal Research's Polarisation Lab. Her research mainly focuses on protest participation and societal polarisation, such as processes of identity formation in conflicting circumstances. The Foresight on Demand Newsletter asked for her views on how protest has changed and what the outlooks for the next few decades are.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is your research relevant to the future? </strong></p>
<p>The future is always difficult to predict, especially the future of protest. Protests are event driven and fluid, but there are trends, and processes that can explain them. Social media appears to be very important. It is changing demonstrations qualitatively, from being organised by unions or social movements, as in the past, to becoming more spontaneous and “leaderless”. This makes them harder to predict and poses a challenge in how to police them. It’s hard to make causal claims, but we now see more young people demonstrating for such causes as Fridays for the Future or Black Lives Matter. I’m also studying social polarisation. There is growing vertical polarisation that is anti-elitist. Citizens are withdrawing from a perceived elite, such as traditional news organisations or government authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why are social protests increasing? </strong></p>
<p>It depends on the field of scholars you ask: political scientists say that there are more actors using protest as an instrument; if you ask sociologists, they say that more types of citizens are using street protest; social psychologists say that those who participated in protests in the past, might be more likely to protest in the future. And people learn from other successes: “if that worked, why shouldn’t we do the same?” Since 2020, however, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the rise of a different sort of protest – more radical. The trend is not necessarily becoming more peaceful. The rise in spontaneous protests is perhaps related to social media, which has a “supersizing” effect. For a low cost you can reach larger groups in less time. Now anyone can organise a protest.</p>
<p><strong>Which trends do you see emerging, in terms of topics, formats or demographics? </strong></p>
<p>Based on the data we have, the number of protests has been growing. There is a global dataset that covers street protests of three types – anti-government demonstrations, general strikes and riots – from 1900 to 2012. There is a pattern of ebb and flow over time but, from 2009 on, the level has been as high as it was in the 1960s. The types of protest are also changing: In the 1960s there were more riots, but from 2009 on there are more demonstrations – a “normalisation of protest”. To complement this dataset, we have compiled a Netherlands-only dataset for 2014-22, to see if this trend is continuing. It has exploded. In 2014, there were around 230 applications for demonstrations in Amsterdam. In 2021, this rose to over 1500. And this is not counting spontaneous protests, which have also increased enormously. This image was generated with the help of GPT-3.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How would you expect political and social movements to develop in the next 20 years? </strong></p>
<p>I can speculate on some themes and dynamics. On themes, there has been an increase in “post-material” protests where the perspective is longer-term and international, such as on climate issues, but bread and butter issues have not disappeared. So, we see a combination. We can expect that to continue. Climate change and related environmental issues – such as nitrogen, farming, land-use and housing problems – also pitch different groups against each other, such as farmers vs Extinction Rebellion. Recently, there were two big demos in Den Haag on the same Sunday. And each referred to the other in their speeches. In terms of dynamics, we can see movements and counter-movements, increasingly reacting to each other in this way. For example, in the Netherlands anti-Zwarte Piet demos come into conflict with nationalist demos. We can also expect this to continue. Trust is in decline, whether trust in others or trust in government. Political efficacy is a key indicator. Some people are going to demonstrations to be heard: “they don’t listen to me, but I need to be heard”. Some protest to state their position or claim, but this is different from going to voice your frustration, it leads to a different atmosphere. There is also a small group of people who believe the politicians of today cannot solve the huge problems we are facing at the moment, such as climate change. And this also creates a different dynamic in a protest. Looking at the dataset for 2014 to 2020, international solidarity protests are also growing. Not necessarily in turnout but in number of demos. We found 79% of protests in Amsterdam were expressing international solidarity, such as with Butan, Palestine, wars or incidents. Capital cities are the stage for these kinds of protest. Globalisation and social media create collective identity. And diasporas often feel a sense of urgency if their community is affected. The world is a village and social media strengthens this trend. It is fascinating how fast such demos are organised. During the attempted coup in Turkey a few years ago there were demos in Rotterdam on the same evening. Conflicts from other countries replicate in their diaspora wherever they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking forward, what major decisions with long-term implications are we faced with at the moment? </strong></p>
<p>Journalists, politicians and police often ask me for advice, and in general I don’t have any, but I see two tricky questions for the future: On the one hand, authorities are there to facilitate a democratic right; on the other, they are responsible for public safety and order. Spontaneous demonstrations make this much more difficult to balance for authorities, so this is a growing dilemma. It’s not just the numbers but the way that protests happen. If authorities expect that demos can get out of hand, then they might suggest a different site. In one example in the Netherlands, police went to activists’ homes, since there was no central organising organisation. This was then reported in the news, leading to more indignation and mobilisation. The second question is around depolarisation. If groups oppose each other, how should we depolarise the situation? In polarised situations you put others at a distance, dehumanise and hate them. Depolarising leads to conversation, restoring trust. But how to do that with groups who do not want to listen to authorities, who distrust them fully? Today, even local government is seen as part of the conflict, part of the polarisation, and not seen as an independent broker.</p>

There are invariably socio-cultural, political, economic, and environmental implications, as well as impacts, influences, “cross-pollination”, and correlations among different technologies.<br><br>The very broad definition of technology itself betrays its intrinsic complexity: a vast field of research involving various technical and scientific disciplines, which examines the application and use of everything that can serve to solve problems. The term “technology” also refers to the aggregate of knowledge, skills, and tools used to design, create, and utilise objects, processes, systems, or services to meet human needs.<br><br>An emerging technology, in particular, is one that is radically new and relatively fast-growing technology [it is not necessarily exponential, as the common dialectics of recent years have conditioned us to expect, yet this has little to do with the mathematical concepts of exponentiality; rapid growth does not imply exponentiality]. It is characterised by a certain degree of coherence (or consistency) that persists over time and has the potential to have a substantial impact on the socio-economic-political domains (understood as the players, institutions, and models of interactions between them, as well as all the processes of knowledge production associated with these domains).<br><br>Its most significant impact lies in the future and thus in the emergency phase: an emerging technology is still quite uncertain and ambiguous. For this reason, it would be prudent to analyse its potential impacts in a timely manner, to avoid getting trapped in Amara’s Law.</p>
","<p><strong>The Law of Amara</strong><br>“We tend to overestimate the effects of a technology in the short term and underestimate its impacts in the long term“.<br><br>Roy Amara, an American researcher who contributed to the reflections on technological changes and their impacts on society, is often quoted today for his “law” which aims to emphasize how we tend to overestimate the immediate impacts of new technologies and underestimate their long-term consequences.<br><br>What we often witness, indeed, is an initial reaction of heightened optimism, in some cases even excessive euphoria, when a new technology enters the market, leading to an overestimation of its potential positive effects/impacts. This optimism, however, tends to wane rather quickly (making way for the excitement about the next technology), subsequently giving rise to a kind of disillusionment: as the technology matures, the enthusiasm diminishes, and we end up no longer clearly seeing its impacts (which does not mean at all that it does not have any; on the contrary, it is almost always in the long term that the most significant impacts occur, even in that climate of general underestimation).<br><br><strong>Emerging Technologies Scanning, its relevance in Futures&amp;Foresight</strong><br>The most significant impacts of an emerging technology lie in the future. According to Amara’s Law, we risk missing these effects, thereby losing opportunities or failing to recognize potential risks that need to be mitigated.<br><br>Emerging Technologies Scanning (ETS) emerges as a core practice within Futures &amp; Foresight (Futures Thinking &amp; Strategic Foresight) and represents a process through which to identify, assess, and monitor emerging technologies that could have a significant impact on society, the economy, politics, the environment, and beyond.<br><br>ETS is a proactive methodology that that focuses on detecting and analysing technology trends that are at an early stage of development but have the potential to become significant in the medium to long term. The object of continuous analysis is not the technology itself, but its possible long-term effects/impacts. The objective is to anticipate and understand how these technologies may have an influence (even a transformative one) on the future (starting from the analysis of their possible impacts on alternative futures).<br><br>From a methodological perspective, Emerging Technologies Scanning (ETS) is essentially a specialised application of horizon scanning, which is an analytical and monitoring process aimed at identifying emerging trends, their potential impacts, and the significant changes they could engender across various sectors. It is an approach that is particularly valuable in areas such as technology, innovation, the environment, politics, and economics, where rapid and unpredictable changes can have significant effects.<br><br>Fun Fact: One of the earliest uses of the term horizon scanning in relation to future studies appeared in 1995 in a document discussing information technology trends and making predictions for the year 2005 [Gates, William H. (1 January 1995) – “Horizon Scanning: Opportunities Technology Will Bring by 2005” – Journal of Business Strategy].<br><br>Within the scope of Futures Studies, Horizon Scanning can be defined as a method used to explore and identify potential issues and future developments that might significantly impact society or a particular sector. This process is especially pertinent in future studies because it employs various methodologies to foresee and influence future changes.<br><br>Specifically, Emerging Technologies Scanning (ETS) allows for the early identification of trends, threats, and opportunities, with a special focus on emerging technologies. The effectiveness of this approach lies in the ability to prepare for and adapt to potential future scenarios, which are often highly unpredictable due to the rapid pace at which technological waves arrive, as well as their convergence and “cross-pollination” [however, it is important to note that ETS alone does not enable the design of possible futures nor the modelling of anticipatory strategies; ETS is used for mapping and visioning, and additional frameworks are required to explore scenarios, and set and perform strategic foresight].</p>

Partly! By documenting and recording the presence of a certain plant, bird or celestial body on citizen science platforms, your sightings enrich the databases researchers use to monitor biodiversity, track bird migration patterns, and map the universe. Paired with machine learning and AI, citizen-powered interactive maps can support local decision making in biodiversity governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combining citizen geolocalisation activities with Earth observation (satellite images, time series, soil data, etc.), Deep Learning (training computers to interpret data and find patterns), and predictive hybrid modelling can be a powerful way to track biodiversity loss. The <a href=""https://guarden.org/"" target=""_blank"">GUARDEN</a>  project develops, enhances and engages with citizen science tools, allowing for environmental observation. Ecological data collected and retrieved through these channels can inform and inspire decisions to safeguard critical ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By October 2025, GUARDEN will deliver a forward-looking decision support application to help ecology stakeholders expand their holistic understanding of ecosystem functioning and biodiversity loss. Identifying drivers in biodiversity transformation will enhance the assessment of ecological and societal impacts of alternative policy decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Led by CIRAD (French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development), this Horizon Europefunded multi-stakeholder partnership aims to transform bottom-up datasets about ecosystems into evidencebased insights to improve the monitoring and governance of biodiversity. GUARDEN aims to assist decisionmaking by using integrated data to predict future challenges to biodiversity and ecosystems from new pressures and drivers. These drivers may include human disturbance, climate change, or land management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GUARDEN project coordinator, Pierre Bonnet, botanist and tropical ecology expert at CIRAD, and project partner Alexis Joly, computer scientist at INRIA, both explain: “Plants don’t move! This makes them key players in characterising local ecosystems”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonnet and Joly are also coordinators of <a href=""https://identify.plantnet.org/"" target=""_blank"">Pl@ntNet</a> , one of the world’s largest citizen science projects for automatic plant identification. They have thus taken on the GUARDEN challenge by building on existing partnerships and expertise on the topic of plant tracking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pl@ntNet is both a website and a mobile application with more than 20 million users worldwide which allows people to share the occurrence of plants in given areas through the automated identification of photographs. “Citizen data coming from Pl@ntNet is then merged with data from other European data infrastructures, programmers, and GEO initiatives to feed predictive AI modelling”, explains Joly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guided by Pl@ntNet’s experience, GUARDEN aims to refine the current scale, bringing geolocalisation to a higher resolution (up to 100 m2), and provide a set of complementary ecological indicators for local ecological monitoring and management.“</p>
<p>GUARDEN will extend the resolution of existing tools, adding layers and indicators to extract information,” explains Joly – “Beyond plant occurrence, also habitat features (pollinators, birds, mammals, etc.) and species interactions will be monitored to conduct deep species distribution modelling”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GUARDEN team is working on a mock-up: the <a href=""https://identify.plantnet.org/prediction"" target=""_blank"">GeoPl@ntNet </a> prototype offers a finer resolution and the chance to access factsheets with multiple ecological indicators representative of a specific area. Scale is an issue, though. According to Bonnet, determining indicator certainty is challenging due to potential geographical bias: “Local indicators may not be shareable with the same level of precision on the European scale”. “The local angle is what makes GUARDEN original and distinctive from other macro-scale geolocalisation tools available” – confirms Bonnet – “A greater awareness of local eco-systems can also influence citizens’ perceptions of local biodiversity management and mitigate reactions to disruptive decisions”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to ecological conservation and restoration, conflicting interests are at stake and trade-offs must be considered (e.g., between conservation policies and development agendas). GUARDEN explores these tensions by broadly involving all land management actors in assessing adaptive ecological scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four heterogeneous local pilots (including a tropical, non-EU, setting) will address critical challenges in biodiversity governance. Case studies will consider the impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems of urban coastal management actions (in Barcelona), energy infrastructure (expansion of energy centre in Cyprus and construction of windfarms in Greece), and development of transport infrastructures (France and Madagascar).&nbsp;</p>
<p>GUARDEN recognises the complexity of managing raw data and therefore places a high priority on data transparency and trust. This helps face the scepticism due to a dual ""prejudice"" involving both the perceived contribution of citizen science to research and the use of deep learning models. Joly points to how “even if AIbased methods are deeply present in our everyday activities, mistrust in these tools is a big challenge”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A responsible and transparent use of AI has the potential to enhance the value of citizen science in the realm of ecology. Safeguarding AI-mediated citizen science may support the development of increasingly precise predictive ecological models and help identify forward-looking biodiversity conservation policies. Promoting the acceptability of these approaches, also through the elaboration of computational standards on the use of hybrid biodiversity data, can boost further research and innovation in the field of biodiversity protection.&nbsp;</p>

Get involved, comment on the scenario and relate the scenario to recent developments!   </p>","<p><strong>Scenario dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Weak global governance; Sustainable lifestyles; Adverse to risk-taking; Vigorous activism</p>
<p><strong>Impacts and risk areas</strong></p>
<p>It's 2040, and the seeds of a new Europe are beginning to emerge following two decades of increased social conflict driven by interrelated <strong>financial, geopolitical, and climate crises</strong>. Between 2020 and 2040 global warming reached <strong>1.5oC </strong>above pre-industrial levels and Europe experienced flooding, heat waves, and emerging diseases that generated substantial social disruption and social insecurity. A series of financial crises, combined with the tensions of economic reorganization (e.g. the loss of jobs), geopolitical tensions, and climate migration have led to <strong>decreased trust in government, large companies, and financial institutions</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Demographics, economy and governance</strong></p>
<p>The past two decades have therefore triggered a rapid change in many social practices and institutions. National government and multinational companies have lost relevance, and <strong>capitalism and national state power are no longer dominant</strong>. With some delay, but with growing influence, a diversity of s<strong>ustainable communities</strong> have now emerged as a bottom-up driven approach to address large-scale environmental challenges such as climate change and sustainable food production. Many of these communities were initially focused on <strong>food system transformations</strong>, because industrial food production underpinned so many of the risks and impact areas described earlier, but also because food is so central to social capital and human health. Initial successes around community organization on food issues allowed trust in new <strong>community councils</strong> to grow. Communities began to support healthy food production and consumption practices and organize against<strong> food multinationals</strong>. As climate migration continued to increase, these increasingly well-organized community forums also took on the integration of migrants into communities and were so effective that national governments began to rely on them to stabilize communities in the face of many challenging global and regional environmental issues. The importance of rural farming areas increased, and many people moved to the countryside to participate in increasingly important sustainable farming communities. Urban areas became better connected to rural areas, in part because good, healthy food was central to communities. Thus, general knowledge related to food production and ecosystem resilience increased across and within communities. By the time <strong>the oil industry finally collapsed completely</strong>, community councils were experienced and held power and the trust of communities, and the major shift in values towards community and environmental resilience was strengthened.</p>
<p>Power now lies in these decentralized communities, networks, and cooperatives, with substantial decreases in wealth inequality and ownership of private property. Europe is witnessing unprecedented growth in the <strong>sharing economy</strong> and an interest in <strong>circular economies</strong>. People are now emphasizing the importance of community, time, and collectives, and de-emphasizing private ownership and wealth creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Life-styles and activism</strong></p>
<p>Today, there are different types of communities across Europe. People live in either coalitions of (1) cities (<strong>city- states)</strong>, which are managed as multifunctional ecosystems with high levels of biodiversity and green infrastructure; (2) <strong>coalitions of villages</strong> and little towns (hybrid communities), within multifunctional landscapes that host cooperatives and small-to-medium scale sustainable farms; or within (3) traditional land-based communities, autonomous regions controlled by <strong>indigenous communities</strong>. While certain aspects of life differ across these communities – e.g. technology, transport, currency, and religion – there is a mainstreaming of values around a relationship with nature, which has shifted from extractive and consumptive, to ones of humans-in-nature, and this is reflected in land and natural resource use.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Practices and technologies</strong></p>
<p>Initially, coalitions and connections between disparate communities were underpinned by decentralized <strong>peer-to-peer web platforms</strong>. Increasingly these platforms became focused on creating positive social and ecological impact and nurturing a vibrant community of young social activists and environmental enthusiasts who were willing to learn from each other and promote each other in creating a sustainable world together. The growth and proliferation of these platforms have now congealed into a loose, bottom-up driven online global sustainability network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>rewilding of nature</strong>, especially urban areas to make them greener and more connected to surrounding rural landscapes, is happening at rapid rates. Europe is now seeing multiple “bright spots” where ecological richness, diversity, and productivity are being regenerated and providing opportunities for people living there to achieve spiritual, and economic development.</p>
<p>The radical <strong>descentralization of energy</strong> production and distribution – together with the cost of renewables crossing a price threshold - has been a key catalyst of these social changes. But other technologies have contributed, such as <strong>the democratization of driverless vehicles</strong>. As these forms of transportation are now becoming ubiquitous, they are helping to free up enormous amounts of space in urban areas that had previously been used for parking areas and wider roadways than were needed, given the smaller number of vehicles on the road and more efficient traffic flow.&nbsp;</p>

These challenges were addressed in the Deep Dive on rural and marine areas in Europe in 2050. We present here policy implications drafted based on the four scenarios developed. </p>","<p>In Scenario A, European Civic Ecovillages pursue self-sufficiency and contribute to establishing a cooperative, locally oriented, caring economy restoring the ecosystem carrying capacities in land and sea. In Scenario B on Sustainable High-tech Europe, European businesses enjoy global leadership in regenerative and multi-functional high-tech solutions for energy, aquaculture and agriculture. In Scenario C on the United States of Europe, centrally planned Europe is divided between intensive use of land and sea and large conservation areas. Scenario D on European Permacrisis portrays Europe in a post-growth and politically scattered context that leads to low rates of innovation and fragmented use of land and sea. Please find the full blog post on the scenarios <a href=""https://www.futures4europe.eu/post/futures-of-using-nature-in-rural-and-marine-europe-in-2050-scenarios-ysffw"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>
<p>Each scenario depicts a different future in rural and marine Europe. None of the scenarios features a decisive solution to the global climate and biodiversity crises. Scenario A forcefully targets the resolution of the biodiversity crisis in Europe, by aligning human practices with nature, but provides little support to global climate and biodiversity crises. Scenario B proactively tackles the biodiversity crisis both in Europe and internationally but struggles with the fragmentation of efforts and with scaling up good practices and wider impact to curb the crisis. Scenarios C and D with intensive use of nature reduce biodiversity. Thanks to European-wide coordination Scenario C can protect vast areas with positive impacts to biodiversity, whereas Scenario D struggles with the major fragmentation of conservation efforts and its detrimental impact on biodiversity. Such challenges illustrate the importance of balanced approaches in developing both local and global solutions to climate and biodiversity crises.</p>
<p>The subsequent further cross-cutting analysis pinpoints some threats and opportunities for rural and marine areas in Europe. This may provide a basis for further reflection on the possible role of R&amp;I policy in Europe in the future and serve as inspiration when designing future R&amp;I programmes in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Economy and technology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In three of the scenarios big business plays a key role in determining what is scaled up but, in parallel, local communities try out solutions. Apart from the rest, in scenario A (European civic ecovillage) both the innovation and deployment are in local communities. R&amp;I programmes searching for scale could well benefit from both dynamics.</li>
<li>All scenarios face the challenge of balancing sustainability and food affordability and security in different modalities of agriculture and aquaculture. The advances may well come from integrated approaches that also consider major shifts in diets and production.</li>
<li>Solving negative externalities of large-scale monoculture continues to be a relevant research stream, for instance via precision farming (see scenario C). Still, research and development is also needed on alternative farming practices that allow closing the loops and controlling the production, for instance, vertical farming, aquaponics and (semi)-closed recirculating water systems for aquaculture highlighted in scenarios A and B.</li>
<li>Multifunctional use of land and sea can provide win-win solutions, e.g. aquaponics, agrivoltaics, agroforestry, marine permaculture and floating PV panels, and thus strike a balance between different needs. This often represents major changes in practices; thus, the local (prosumer) communities need to be part of the process for their insights and buy-in (especially prevalent in scenarios A and B).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demographics, lifestyles and values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All the scenarios depict the future of rural and marine areas related to socio-ecological crises. Further research could aim to strengthen civic resilience. Could measures to increase crisis preparedness among individual and local communities be developed?</li>
<li>Research on the future of rural and marine areas and demographic changes could be useful given the above-mentioned uncertainties. For instance, water scarcity or other climate-related crises may induce major migrations also in Europe.</li>
<li>Fragmentation in rural and marine communities and planning can become a major concern. Even if good practices exist, fragmentation hampers their scaling up, while coordination may breed thriving active local communities. R&amp;I programmes could provide opportunities for further mapping, showcasing and enhancing the mutual learning between good practices of local community-based organisations.</li>
<li>The livelihood of rural communities is to a greater or lesser degree entangled with urben spaces and how their inhabitants value rural communities. R&amp;I can be involved in pursuing better connections between urban and rural, such as online farmers’ markets, remote working and the future evolution of rural infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Governance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The diffusion of innovations is crucial for sustainable rural and marine areas. In this respect, and where the framework conditions favour planning and encourage investment, it should be easier to scale up. R&amp;I policy should aim to improve framework conditions, including the predictability of government R&amp;I programmes.</li>
<li>Integrated spatial planning of urban and rural areas is a key issue. Space, whether land or sea, could be envisaged as an integrated territory defined by orography and natural geography, e.g. drainage basins, regional watersheds and coastal seabed (see the figure below), rather than socio-political boundaries. R&amp;I policy instruments could be demarcated with such an integrated approach in mind; joint cross-national research institutes and infrastructure could be established.</li>
<li>The use of spaces could benefit from extending user rights. For instance, land ownership models in some rural areas could be replaced or complemented with public ownership and user rights, learning from the practices within the marine sector, with the state granting user rights in certain areas or through the designation of protected areas, excluding or revoking user rights previously in force. Experimentation, e.g. in regulatory sandboxes, could also rely on public sector innovation processes. Before experimentation in regulatory sandboxes can take place, there is a need for R&amp;I efforts to detail how the user rights could be extended in different conditions and what would be the impacts to different stakeholders.</li>
<li>The scenarios related to diverse democratic practices. Policy labs on citizen participation in decisions on rural and marine areas could serve to connect citizens with these areas. Direct involvement of local communities in R&amp;I programmes could be a means to avoid NIMBY effects and ensure their support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are major risks in a patchy land and sea use that segments ecosystems and breaks up ecological corridors, diminishing the biodiversity and the resilience of nature. R&amp;I programmes on integrated spatial planning of land and sea, also including for in-land waters, can pave the way towards more resilient, more circular water use and integrated management for addressing tensions between alternative uses of land and sea and in parallel ensuring sufficient size of protected areas.</li>
<li>The effects of monoculture and economic specialisation reducing societal and ecological resilience could be mitigated by concentrating them on limited high-intensity production areas and by scaling up regenerative alternative practices. Both these directions could be promoted via R&amp;I instruments to experiment and learn about ecological and socio-economic implications.</li>
<li>Technology could play an important role in monitoring nature to understand it and the impacts of human actions. Multidisciplinary research on resilience in rural and marine areas could help increase preparedness, including integrated planning supported with biodiversity monitoring combining in-situ sensors and remote space technologies and advances in data analytics (AI) and construction of digital twins of integrated spaces for developing reliable future projections. Also, advances in guidance and toolkits could serve to improve the reliability of citizen science.</li>
<li>Regenerative ecosystem-based approaches and practices could strengthen synergies between nature restoration and production activities. R&amp;I programmes could experiment scaling up such practices, and with how nature restoration and rewilding could be further connected to climate mitigation and climate adaptation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final remarks</strong></p>
<p>This brief is the result of one of eight Deep Dive Foresight Studies in the project ‘<a href=""https://www.futures4europe.eu/project/european-ri-foresight-and-public-engagement-for-horizon-europe-bveiy"" target=""_blank"">European R&amp;I Foresight and Public Engagement for Horizon Europe</a> ’ conducted by the Foresight on Demand consortium for the European Commission. During the spring of 2023, an expert team identified factors of change and organised two scenario and one policy implications workshops also engaging experts from academia, business and public administration around Europe. The process was also supported by discussions in the Horizon Europe Foresight Network.

ESPAS, or the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System, unites nine EU institutions and bodies to collaboratively identify and analyze medium- and long-term trends affecting the EU, informing policy-makers about their implications.</p>","<p>The Fourth Global Trends ESPAS report is available <a href=""https://espas.eu/gtr.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Eamonn Noonan</em></strong><em>, co-author of the report, is an official of the European Parliament Research Service in the Foresight Unit, which has had a quality secretarial role for ESPAS ever since the unit was set up in 2015.  </em><strong><em>Salvatore Finamore, </em></strong><em>also a co-author, is a member of the Analysis and Research Team in the General Secretary of the Council of the European Union and was involved in the initial scoping and facilitating parts of the foresight process. </em><strong><em>Geraldine Barry</em></strong><em> is the editor of the ESPAS report and Adviser for Knowledge Synthesis at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. She coordinated the drafting efforts across all 9 European institutions and bodies involved in the process.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What key global trends have emerged since the last ESPAS report, and how does it compare to previous editions in terms of its identified trends and recommended strategies</strong>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Eamonn: </strong>In the previous report, we addressed the full spectrum of trends, such geopolitics, economics, and environment. While we’re still addressing them, there's a sense of intensification. Things are more serious now than they were five years ago. Two elements have emerged since 2019, namely more fragmentation, both in geopolitics and in democracy. We were already aware that geopolitical tensions had worsened, and now there is much greater awareness of democratic fragility. The other dimension is interconnectedness. Democratic fragility is a source of geopolitical fragility, and vice versa. The interconnections across trends are now more apparent and more appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Salvatore: </strong>Foresight is a study of possible futures, but there is also another element, namely the study of present images of the future. That’s why it's interesting to look at previous ESPAS reports and see how they compare. In this report, one key observation is that we are more focussed on the uncertainties we face. The previous report contained more definitive statements, which was probably in part a stylistic choice, but perhaps also a reflection of a different time. Our current report sees the future as less certain: in fact, one of our main sections for each chapter is entitled ‘key uncertainties to 2040’. Another aspect is that for some trends you can expect to see a large degree of continuity with previous reports, but also signs of a shift in the accompanying narratives. The clearest example perhaps is that of an increased awareness of the importance of climate change adaptation, together with mitigation. While climate change was already a well-established trend at the time of previous reports, adaptation is also increasingly seen as a key component of the strategies that we need to put in place, as we are aware that some elements of climate change are simply unavoidable given the current trends. Additionally, elements such as climate, energy, food security, health increasingly seem to have geopolitics attached to them. Indeed, if you look for ‘geopolitics’ in the text of the current report compared to the previous one, it appears twice as frequently. Reflecting on the present images of the future, I think this ‘geopoliticization of everything’ is a very significant development that we didn't see previously and which for me also carries risks for self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>What trends were clearest to identify and which still present uncertainty in light of this interconnectedness?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Salvatore:</strong> The key uncertainties section of the climate change trend was a challenge because we don't want to present climate change as uncertain. There are of course uncertainties linked to climate change but overall there is more clarity due to quantitative data. Therefore, the trend is relatively more straightforward compared to others that are more qualitative, for example geopolitics. At the same time, there is also a risk in presenting some trends as too well established for us to have agency in altering their course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Eamonn: </strong>On the economic front, discussions on how to return to prosperity and how to achieve competitiveness continue. Forecasting, as distinct from foresight, can help in the near term, but we need to use foresight in preparing for the long term.</p>
<p><strong>What foresight methodologies were used in the report?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Salvatore:</strong> We started with an initial scoping exercise with the members of the core team, which was a larger group of colleagues than just the final drafters. There, we used a simple environmental scan based on the STEEP framework and then a clustering exercise where we scoped what subjects we see in our collective awareness. After doing this, we had a first round of validation with the ESPAS steering group. Then we engaged in more in-depth trend analysis, looking at drivers and impact analysis. For each trend we analyzed, we employed a modified futures wheel approach where we examined both the historical drivers and the potential future impacts. This involved making links and identifying overlaps to understand the interaction of these elements. To further explore the systemic complexity and interconnections between various drivers, we also conducted a cross-impact analysis. This allowed us to map and analyze the intricate relationships and dependencies across different factors. We had several rounds of consultations with experts, both from the EU institutions and outside. Finally, we also incorporated some of the results of the ESPAS horizon scanning process.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Geraldine: </strong>We had to identify the key uncertainties beyond what we already know, as it is easier to focus on what we observe now. Compared with the previous report, the interconnectedness and convergence of trends pose difficult challenges, which we tried to frame in the strategic choices in the last chapter, striving not to be prescriptive in any way. Running deep dive workshops across the EU institutions and reflecting on each trend was very helpful. One of the things we hope to transmit is that there is agency and choice in the strategic decisionmaking that comes as a result of responding to trends. Lastly, this being an interinstitutional process with nine EU bodies also meant maximising knowledge synthesis and condensing a lot of information. Our steering group ensured we had a strong approval process throughout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Eamonn: </strong>Strategic foresight is actually intended to challenge orthodox viewpoints. In an exercise of this kind, there can be reservations about certain framings. Ultimately the strategic choices identified in this report are broadly compatible with the priorities of the mainstream political groupings within the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Foresight looks decades into the future, compared to the length of political mandates. To what extent does embedding foresight in policy making also align with the decisions taken by elected representatives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Salvatore:</strong> One of the key messages of the report is that we have long-term trends and we need to act now if we want to shape the long-term future. What we convey is that, ultimately, if we don't act, then the trends will make the choice for us.</p>
<p><strong>Eamonn:</strong> The report seeks to provide a long-term analysis that can inform policy and strategy formulation today. Several trends do not align with the EU's strategic interest in collaborating with others to reduce global polarization and prevent rivalries from escalating into conflicts. If these trends continue and we do nothing, then it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the peace and prosperity that the EU hopes will continue. The overall tone of this report suggests that, if left unattended, several things are not going in a direction that benefits Europe. At the same time, communicating uncertainty is very difficult. Politicians and, indeed, the general public, expect to have control and stability. The shift from the clear-cut certainties of the Cold War, where the lines between ""good"" and ""bad"" were well-defined, to a more ambiguous political landscape creates a complex environment. This trend toward uncertainty requires strategies to reassure people that, despite unpredictability, there are ways to manage it. It's a reminder of the importance of flexibility and preparedness for various outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>How should then European countries adjust their long-term strategic planning to accommodate for unseen global shifts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Salvatore:</strong> It’s really about building preparedness, so thinking in a way that can prepare us for different futures. It's more about putting yourself in a position where you can easily accommodate for whatever the future may throw at you.</p>
<p><strong>Eamonn:</strong> One point that we make is that once you establish a strategic direction, it's good for Europe if the different institutions act in an aligned fashion. That equally applies to different policy areas. If you're doing something in one policy area that conflicts with the objectives of another policy area, then you make it harder to achieve overall strategic objectives.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways do you expect this report to be taken up by policymakers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Salvatore:</strong> This report will be part of the briefings that senior level policymakers will receive. Personally, I expect this kind of report to contribute to the policy discourse and the broader narrative rather than policy itself. It's meant to stimulate a debate and I think it will create an impact by influencing the information environment in which policymaking is conceived and implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Eamonn: </strong>The 2019 report significantly overlapped with the European Commission's priorities, likely reflecting the prevailing thoughts within the institutions about upcoming challenges. Similarly, this report may overlap with the issues identified by the incoming Commission. This is more correlation than causation. The new Commission will take office after the European Parliament elections, which will refelect many different perspectives. When that all comes together it will reflect a much more diverse European picture, centred and rooted in the Member States. The ESPAS report draws from a broad spectrum of inputs, but it is influenced by thinking within the participating institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Geraldine:</strong> The timing of this report is very deliberate, as it was released in April before the upcoming mandates of the Commission, Parliament, and the Council. The aim is to stimulate reflection and discussion and encourage the notion of embedding the capacity to adapt quickly, not just stay on one course. If this approach becomes more reflexive rather than exceptional, it would entail a significant shift in traditional policy-making practices.</p>

","<p><strong>What is your role in the Eye of Europe Project and what are you currently working on? </strong><br><br>I am the task leader for Foresight Practices, which also includes the organization of two high-level European Foresight conferences, one of which is the Futures4Europe Conference held in May in Vienna; the second one will be held in 2026. These events offer Foresight practitioners and policy administrators opportunities to exchange knowledge and learn from each other. Other assets are the Mutual Learning Events with our partner, the Technology Center Prague, which stimulate knowledge exchange on pressing trends with other foresight experts. Finally, we will conduct a workshop to formulate a vision for the future role of foresight for Research and Innovation policy.<br> <br><strong>What will in, your view, be the relevance of foresight methodologies for European innovation in light of recent geopolitical and economic developments worldwide?</strong><br><br>There are currently many disruptions taking place that 15 years ago, or even five years ago, we would never have anticipated. What we can learn from foresight is to stay agile and flexible in our anticipation, think out of the box, work trans-disciplinarily, and make considerations about the future that go against what we normally expect. Crucial in this is the discussion and exchange with our fellow citizens and include diversity.<br><br><strong>What is a piece of futures-related work or publication that you would recommend to read, either in academia or in popular culture? <br></strong> <br>The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui (German: Der aufhaltsame Aufstieg des Arturo Ui), 1941,  by Bertolt Brecht. A fascinating play and also a satirical allegory potraying how authoritarianism can take hold when society turns a blind eye. <br><br><strong>Imagine you’re living in 2050. What’s one groundbreaking innovation or societal shift you think might define that world?<br></strong><br>The climate crisis is the biggest challenge we are facing. In this context, one groundbreaking social innovation would be introducing social compensation mechanisms to accompany climate mitigation measures. Economic inequality is a problem for climate policy in two key ways: at the top, extreme wealth often translates into excessive consumption — from private jets to multiple large homes — resulting in a disproportionately high carbon footprint. At the other end, many people are so focused on the cost of daily living that climate concerns understandably take a back seat. Appeals for a voluntary, individual change have led to conflicts in the past. That’s why it’s crucial to ensure that climate policy includes social fairness. Without addressing inequality itself, building broad support for meaningful climate action becomes much harder.<br></p>

But little attention has been given to identifying the beneficial initial conditions for <strong>future Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong>. <strong>The initial conditions for AGI will determine if Artificial Super Intelligence will evolve to benefit humanity or not. </strong>Even if international agreements are reached on the beneficial initial conditions for AGI, a global governance system will still be needed to enforce them and oversee the development and management of AGI. Since it may take ten, twenty, or more years to create and ratify an international AGI treaty and establish a global AGI governance system, and since some experts believe it is possible to have AGI within ten to twenty years, it is therefore important to work on these issues as soon as possible. The most critical AGI issues are its initial conditions and global governance. These issues are important for governments to get right from the outset. <a href=""https://millennium-project.org/transition-from-artificial-narrow-to-artificial-general-intelligence-governance/"" target=""_blank""><strong>The Millennium Project</strong></a><strong> </strong> is currently exploring these issues.</p>
","<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<p>AI is advancing so rapidly, that s<a href=""https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/"" target=""_blank"">ome experts believe that AGI could occur before the end of this decade </a> (1); hence, it is time to begin serious deliberations about AGI. There are three categories of Artificial Intelligence (AI):  narrow, general, and super. I define AGI as a general-purpose AI that can learn, edit its code, act autonomously to address novel and complex problems with novel and complex strategies similar to or better than humans, as distinct from Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) that has a more narrow purpose. Artificial Super Intelligence is AGI that has become independent of humans, developing its own purposes, goals, and strategies without human understanding, awareness, or control and continually increasing its intelligence beyond humanity as-a-whole.</p>
<p>A gray area between Narrow and General is developing now. Large platforms are being created of many ANIs such as <a href=""https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent"" target=""_blank"">Gato</a> by DeepMind of Alphabet which is a deep neural network that can perform 604 different tasks from managing a robot to recognizing images and playing games – it is not AGI, but Gato is more than the usual ANI: “The same network with the same weights can play Atari, caption images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more, deciding based on its context whether to output text, joint torques, button presses, or other tokens (<a href=""https://openreview.net/forum?id=1ikK0kHjvj"" target=""_blank"">Overview AI values, principle, an ethics</a> ). Also the Wu Dao 2.0 by the <a href=""https://www.baai.ac.cn/english.html"" target=""_blank"">Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence </a>has 1.75 trillion parameters (<a href=""https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3135764/us-china-tech-war-beijing-funded-ai-researchers-surpass-google-and"" target=""_blank"">Beijing-funded AI language model tops Google and OpenAI in raw numbers</a>) trained from both text and graphic data.

","<p>AGI should not be confused with General Purpose AI Systems (<a href=""https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14278-2021-INIT/en/pdf"" target=""_blank"">GPAIS</a>  - Council of the European Union General Purpose AI Systems ) which is defined as an AI system “able to perform generally applicable functions such as image/speech recognition, audio/video generation, pattern detection, question answering, translation etc. These systems rely on “transfer learning” applying knowledge from one task to another. <a href=""https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/"" target=""_blank"">ChatGPT</a> (Optim izing Language Models for Dialogue) is an upgrade from GPT-3 to GPT-3.5 that can generate human-like text and perform a wide range of language tasks such as translation, summarization, and question answering. (GPT-3 uses 175 billion machine learning parameters.) ChatGPT interacts with the user to produce sophisticated text from simple instructions or questions.  See Appendix for an example of how it answered the first question in the second section below. It can also write and correct code, write music in different styles, organize information, and other uses being invented now. SingularityNet is also in this gray area.  It brings together AI developers who want to create AGI and share code such that AGI might emerge from many interactions. The Athens Roundtable held at the European Parliament on 1-2 December 2022 did discuss General Purpose AI, but not AGI. The Future of Life Institute has assessed General Purpose AI and the AI Act, but not AGI (see <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/General-Purpose-AI-and-the-AI-Act.pdf"" target=""_blank"">report)</a> .</p>
<p><strong>The Global AGI Race</strong></p>
<p>AGI does not exist. President Putin has said whoever leads AI will rule the world. <a href=""https://d1y8sb8igg2f8e.cloudfront.net/documents/translation-fulltext-8.1.17.pdf"" target=""_blank"">China plans to lead international competition by 2030</a> . Although “AGI” or “Artificial General Intelligence” does not appear in the State Council Notice on the Issuance of the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan: A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (Released: July 20, 2017), terms such as “strong generalization capabilities…AI key general technology system…cross-medium analytical reasoning technology” does seem like AGI and the plan states that China will be “occupying the commanding heights of AI technology.” Since ANI is with us now, one can assume that President Putin and the Chinese Plan were referring to AGI. Therefore, it is also reasonable to assume that the “Great AGI Race” is on with both governments and corporations. In such a race, Deep Mind Co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis said people may cut corners making future AGI less safe.

<p><strong>Will AGI create more jobs than it replaces? What is different this time?</strong></p>
<p>Previous technological revolutions from the agricultural age to industrial age and on to the information age created more jobs than each age replaced. But the advent of AGI and its impacts on employment will be different this time because of: 1) the acceleration of technological change; 2) the globalization, interactions, and synergies among NTs (Next Technologies such as synthetic biology, nanotechnology, quantum computing, 3D/4D printing, robots, drones, computational science, as well as both ANI and especially AGI; 3) the existence of a global platform—the Internet—for simultaneous technology transfer with far fewer errors in the transfer; 4) standardization of data bases and protocols; 5) few plateaus or pauses of change allowing time for individuals andcultures to adjust to the changes; 6) billions of empowered people in relatively democratic free markets able to initiate activities; and 7) machines that can learn how you do what you do, and then do it better than you. Anticipating the possible impacts of AGI and preparing for the impacts prior to the advent of AGI could prevent social and political instability (Glenn, Jerome and the Millennium Project team, Work/Technology 2050: Scenarios and Actions, The Millennium Project, Washington, DC, 2020.), as well as facilitate it broader acceptance.</p>
","<p>AGI is expected to address novel and extremely complex problems by initiating research strategies from exploring the Internet of Things (IoT), interviewing experts, making logical deductions, learning from experience and reinforcement without the need for its own massive databases, and continually editing and re-writing its own code to continually improve its own intelligence. An AGI might be tasked to create plans and strategies to avoid war, protect democracy and human rights, manage complex urban infrastructures, meet climate change goals, counter transnational organized crime, and manage water-energy-food availability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve such abilities without the future nightmares of science fiction, global agreements with all relevant countries and corporations will be needed. To achieve such an agreement or set of agreements, many questions should be addressed. Here are just two:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How to manage the international cooperation necessary to build international agreements and a governance system while nations and corporations are in an intellectual “arms race” for global leadership. (IAEA and nuclear weapon treaties did create governance systems during the Cold War arms race.)</li>
<li>And related: How can international agreements and a governance system prevent an AGI “arms race” and escalation from going faster than expected, getting out of control and leading to war, be it kinetic, algorithmic, cyber, or information warfare?</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the EC has led on some complex multilateral agreements, it could perform a great service by addressing some of these questions.<br>Read more on the research on General Artificial Intelligence here or download the full report below.</p>

This post builds on the brief resulting from one of eight Deep Dive Foresight Studies in the project ‘European R&I Foresight and Public Engagement for Horizon Europe’ conducted by the Foresight on Demand’ consortium for the European Commission. During the autumn of 2023, the core group identified factors of change and organised two scenario and one policy implications workshops also engaging experts from academia, business, and public administration around Europe. We aimed to assist policy-makers by devising four possible future scenarios in 2040 and by considering their implications for today.</p>","<p>Europe is facing major societal challenges (climate change, demographic trends, cultural shifts induced by technology, new geopolitical balances, among others), which are radically changing the landscape of the European Union. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the instability of the markets and the economy and the difficulties of national and European public administrations in responding to the priorities of the citizens, have contributed to the increased detachment and lack of trust among citizens. While this poses risks to the formal structures and institutions traditionally framing and holding together the European social system based on democracy and the free market, the EU is pursuing major transition programmes in order to respond to the major societal challenges. Its concerns with resilience extend to both the structures and institutions that hold Europe together, and to the transition programmes that it wishes to drive.</p>
<p>We consider civic resilience, as the ability of a community, city, or society to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and adapt to adversities, challenges, or disruptions. Civic resilience is a core concern in crises as well as in transitions. It is about civil society surviving changes (disruptions, tipping points, crises etc. whether they are abrupt or founded in long-term developments). It calls for local commitment, preparedness beyond the support of the public administration and the private sector. It's about civil society, both the community (social organizations) and the individuals (citizens), taking the initiative – as a key actor framing any social system – to lead social change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploring alternative futures addressing radical changes in society can help better prepare for future crises and strengthen the resilience of civil society today. Therefore, we aimed to assist policy-makers by devising four possible future scenarios in 2040 and by considering their implications for today. While the challenges considered are global, policy implications are addressed especially about the European research and innovation policy. Four alternative scenarios were identified around two main axes (technological and economic adaptation and social &amp; environmental stewardship):&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The first scenario, where both techno-economic adaptation and socio-environmental stewardship are high, represents an ideal future. This scenario (best of worlds) would be featured by low levels of community and individual resilience (welfare annihilates survival instinct): civil society would not be ready to face an unexpected event, totally devoid of self-protection mechanisms.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The second scenario, where techno-economic adaptation is low but socio-environmental stewardship is high, means institutional void but strong community consensus. Here the risk - in terms of civic resilience - is that if the community prevails totally, then individuality is cancelled. Citizens are subordinated to the collective, which means the coexistence of a high level of community resilience and a low level of individual resilience.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The third scenario, where high techno-economic adaptation meets low socio-environmental stewardship, represents a risk of rupture in the social fabric due to ubiquity and omnipresence of technology (AI, Singularity, Transhumanism?), an anomic society where community resilience is low -or even maybe annulled - even if individual resilience may be high; in a homogenised alienated society where social institutions are annulled the only possible resistance may come from the individuals (a minority).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The fourth scenario, the worst-case one, represents the survival mode where the menace is extreme, total and constant. Low techno-economic adaptation meets low socio-environmental stewardship, producing a vicious circle of desolation characterized by the fact that the social fabric is broken. It would be a radical context where both community and individual resilience may be high because hostile environments reinforce survival instinct (both individual and collective).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each scenario provides a different point of view towards the situation in the EU today and what could and should be done by EU R&amp;I policy, and by related policy fields that will affect the efficacy of the R&amp;I policy pursuits towards civic resilience. Together they point us to the following policy recommendations:</p>
<p>R&amp;I policy should enable and promote crisis prevention and preparedness – environmental monitoring and earth science are important, as are their connections to civil protection and crisis management practices. Technological innovations are potentially very important here and so is technology assessment, aiming to minimize the negative effects of technology use, while maximizing the positive ones.</p>
<p>R&amp;I policy should aim to strengthen the resilience of infrastructure and to enable a balance between the infrastructure needs of society and environmental and ecosystem effects from its construction, use and decommissioning. Innovations in materials and construction technologies and techniques are important as are innovations in decommissioning and recycling technologies and processes, and in the monitoring and management of the state of infrastructures and in their use.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the unpredictability of the social effects of technology and the importance of public services and local actors for civic resilience, it is important to engage broadly with actors responsible for public services in the definition of R&amp;I policy agendas. Thus R&amp;I policy can:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>stimulate radical social innovation through “glocal” (local but with global impact) creative initiatives, e.g. via living labs,&nbsp;</li>
<li>identify and define boundaries for upcoming cutting-edge technologies implantation, prioritizing social stability and welfare,&nbsp;</li>
<li>define agendas in resilience research, oriented to explore new potential needs and new ways of addressing existing needs, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>to make existing public services more effective and resilient, for instance via education and health.In addition to R&amp;I agendas, civic resilience can be strengthened by improving governance, local democracy, public services and education policies to:&nbsp;</li>
<li>improve social empathy - addressing societal needs through a more human-centered-business, UX-oriented, bottom-up vision. Prevent social anomy and get closer to the citizens´ daily reality and priorities;&nbsp;</li>
<li>prevent ecosystem degradation - by promoting environmental stewardship, mainly stimulating bottom-up local collaborative and innovative initiatives;&nbsp;</li>
<li>prevent cultural and moral degradation by promoting diversity, internationalization, and the preservation of cultural heritage and the basic European set of values: equality, law and fraternity; reinforcing democracy.</li>
</ul>

On one hand, he is a professor in foresight, strategy and innovation at the Faculty of Economics and Management at the University of Lisbon. On the other hand, he founded a foresight company five years ago, IF Insight Foresight, focussing on consulting, horizon scanning and strategic intelligence, as well as other strategy and innovation projects. He talked to Futures4Europe about Insight Foresight’s recently developed tool ORION and how it could revolutionise foresight practices.</p>","<p><strong>Tell us about ORION.</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ifforesight.com/whatis-orion"" target=""_blank"">Orion</a> is a  horizon scanning and intelligent system that incorporates different kinds of databases in powerful ways to capture, identify, categorise and make sense of different driving forces, such as megatrends, specific trends, wild cards and weak signals. Scanning stems from the principle of a holistic and extensive approach to explore the future. Our tool uses databases to enable individuals and organisations to extract, identify and make sense of the complex, holistic and systemic world in which we live. For about six years, we have used what we call a scanning and intelligence database, which through ORION can be organised both for consulting and also capacity building and training provisions.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain how the tool captures, categorises, and leverages drivers of change, insights and signals?</strong></p>
<p>We synthesise data from both curated and non curated databases and integrate them with the knowledge of ORION AI, which is the combination of these databases with the power of generative AI. The database is organised around 20 megatrends that encompass around 1,400 different trends and signals. Each one of these elements and its metadata was curated by our team, or a third party. Lastly, the second layer of the database is designed for the identification and classification of non-curated information (such as articles) from various sources. These include more than 20,000 driving forces that keep growing and expanding. We can organise and extract specific trends, clusters, connections patterns from each layer or the entire scanning database using specific algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>How does it help you find what you’re looking for?</strong></p>
<p>When you ask a question to ORION AI, the system will go through a three-step process. Firstly, it will consult the first curated layer with megatrends and trends. Then, it explores the second layer, which consists of more fluid, non-curated articles. Based on this, it will go through the knowledge of the large language model, in this case GPT 4, to obtain the most relevant answers on the foresight horizon scanning query. In this sense, it is a co-pilot, an interactive conversation. Each time you interact and ask the system questions, you improve the way that you are talking and interacting with the system.</p>
<p><strong>Who will be the primary users of your tool?</strong></p>
<p>You do not have to be from a specific background or industry to explore and extract value and knowledge relevance from the database, hence why the many global forces and megatrends included. It's a global platform with global content in which you can make deep dives. Part of this will be available for public use, so you can explore multiple megatrends and the detailed description of each. After a certain level of depth, a subscription will be required to have access to the entire set of megatrends and trends and make use of the generative AI assistant. For example, you can look for trends related to the future of biotechnology, but if you want to go deeper and know more specific applications of this, you can make a deep dive and explore the topic more narrowly.</p>
<p><strong>How does this tool address potential biases and ensure the ethical use of AI-generated insights?</strong></p>
<p>In the construction of ORION, we still employ a human approach, in other words, the curation of the database and its sources. Of course, through keyword filtering and text, we cannot exclude our own biases. When we combine these with generative AI, we generate clusters or global forces not just from the top down, but also enabling the database to create its own clusters through a algorithms. What emerges from the algorithmic approach is different from our approach to organising our database, which is how we can identify blind spots and biases by comparing what our team has done and what the language model has done. When you use generative AI and large language models, even those trained by our own database, it is inevitable that biases translate to the generated answers. They will always be there, so, never take for granted the results obtained from the system. However, I believe that what you can get is so powerful and it can be so insightful.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to those who would like to use AI for strategic foresight?</strong></p>
<p>My first advice is don't be afraid of exploring the new world of generative AI that is already disrupting strategic foresight, futures horizon scanning and strategic intelligence. We are using powerful algorithms to identify patterns and things that two or three years ago was completely impossible for many people who work in this field. However, you need to be aware of the biases that can ensue and iterate these with your team, workshops, participatory methods, hence why you should see this tool as a co-pilot. Use it with caution and be aware that we are just at the beginning of this journey in which generative AI has an impact in our personal and professional lives.

In order to find answers to the complex questions of uncertain future developments the foresight team  combined several approaches of foresight for anticipatory governance. This includes a systematic horizon scanning of existing reports for weak signals of change in all fields of society such as societal developments,  technology, economy, environment, policy and values. The literature and data based information collection was combined with explorative exercises like a scenario development, a visioning process and a gap analysis to develop new ideas for policy options. The engagement of stakeholders and experts on consumer policy was crucial throughout the whole process, in particular for the analysis of influencing factors, alternative scenarios and suggestions for policy actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its anticipatory and exploratory nature, the study was a pilot project for the implementation of comprehensive strategic foresight in DG JUST. Accordingly, the project was also used to build capacity for foresight in dealing with future uncertainty. Representatives of several departments of the DG actively participated in the workshops in all four steps of the process and thus got to know and tested the methods of foresight. These include participatory and qualitative foresight methods such as horizon scanning and scoping for identifying key future trends, scenario and vision development for exploring different possible futures and identifying challenges, and roadmapping approaches for developing options for action. Another important <br>element of the study was the intensive involvement of stakeholders in all steps of the process, especially in the development and discussion of future scenarios and in the development of new policy ideas.</p>
<p>The DG can use the various results of the Foresight process for the further future-proof implementation of the New Consumer Agenda. The trends examined for the scenarios can be reviewed at regular intervals with regard to new developments and impacts on consumption and consumer protection. The scenarios provide an overview of possible futures of consumption in Europe after the COVID-19 pandemic and serve for exploring the scope of possible developments. The visions for consumer protection and empowerment, especially of vulnerable groups and consumers with special needs, summarise stakeholders' expectations for consumer policy in the next 10 years. The action fields prioritised together with stakeholders for consumer policy in and after the pandemic and the ideas for policy actions can now be used by the EC to set its own priorities and develop ideas into concrete actions. The EC may not want to take up all the ideas presented here, but the suggestions can provide guidance on which issues are of high importance from a stakeholder perspective in the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

When almost one hundred years later global roaming appeared, followed by five  generations of wireless technologies, the speed, capacity, and overall performance of mobile communication had already transformed our everyday  lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another technological cycle is around the corner (typical duration: 8-10 years) and European research  is busy planning the advent of the sixth generation (6G)  of wireless technologies, expected to hit the market in 2030. Through the collaborative efforts of the 5G  Public-Private Partnership (<a href=""https://5g-ppp.eu/"" target=""undefined"">5G PPP</a>) and the Smart  Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (<a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/smart-networks-and-services-joint-undertaking"" target=""undefined"">SNS JU</a>),  the European Commission has joined forces with  public and private actors, including the ICT industry,  academic institutions and research organisations, to  enable the evolution of 5G ecosystems and promote  6G research in Europe. Among the EU-funded R&amp;I flagship projects exploring 6G connectivity is the Hexa-X ‘family’ with its two ‘brother’ projects: <a href=""https://hexa-x.eu/"" target=""undefined"">Hexa-X </a>(Horizon2020 – 5G PPP) and <a href=""https://hexa-x-ii.eu/"" target=""undefined"">Hexa-X-II</a> (Horizon Europe – 6G SNS JU), both led by Nokia and supported by Ericsson’s technical management. Over a total period of 4.5 years, the Hexa-Xs will produce a blueprint for a sustainable, inclusive, and trustworthy 6G platform able to meet the future needs of serving and transforming  society and business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hexa-X I, which ran from January 2021 to June 2023, established the vision for the next generation of wireless  technologies by considering potential use cases and key societal values, aiming for a human-centric network  design. Building on the architectural insights provided by Hexa-X, Hexa-X II kicked off in January 2023 with a goal to deliver a system blueprint for a European 6G platform by June 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the USA and Asia may be well-positioned in the global race for future wireless connectivity, Europe's strong foundation in research and innovation, supported by EU funding and enriched by partnerships, enhances its competitiveness, and fosters technological sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mikko Uusitalo, Head of Radio Systems Research at Nokia Bell Labs Finland, is the overall lead of the Hexa X endeavour (including Hexa-X-II): “our rich consortium, which has grown from 25 to 44 partners over the  course of the projects, and our expert advisory group empowered our vision for the design and architecture of the next generation of wireless networks”. Hexa-X partners, who represent key European industry  stakeholders, along with the full value chain of future connectivity solutions (network vendors, operators,  verticals, and technology providers), as well as research institutes and universities, put their foresight cap on.  Their deep knowledge supported the project’s scanning of societal, economic, regulatory, and technological trends, the identification of connectivity drivers, and the selection of use cases for current and new 6G  applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of Hexa-X's vision for the future is an everyday experience enhanced by the seamless integration  of human, digital, and physical worlds. 6G aims to connect these worlds through an ecosystem of networks, sub-networks, and device technologies. This ecosystem has the potential to drive global economic growth  while transforming industries and societal spheres such as education, skills, and the labour market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While 4G has enabled and 5G significantly enhanced our ability to consume digital media anywhere, at any  time, 6G will deliver a total immersion in virtual worlds, with communication, localisation, sensing, and imaging  Source: Freepic coming together in the generation of augmented and mixed realities. We are looking at 6-dimension (6D)  experiences, in which the ‘traditional’ 3 spatial dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude) are enriched by 3 orientation dimensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With extreme connectivity and ultra-high data rate, 6G has the potential to power disruptive solutions for industries relying on interactions between machines, humans, and the environment, including automotive, transportation, agriculture, education, healthcare, and urban planning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that these technologies bring value to society, Hexa-X is adding value-based design to performance-oriented goals for future connectivity networks. The key is to develop 6G around three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>6G networks can be energy-efficient in terms of choice of materials, circularity practices, and operational  modes. They can rely on ecological energy sources and optimise overall energy consumption through  cloudification and automation. Part of this effort is also supporting sustainability in other sectors. “With its  potential for simulation and real-time monitoring thorough digital twins, 6G can become a powerful ally for the  twin digital and ecological transition,” Uusitalo explains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connectivity in 2030 will likely be regarded as a basic human right for accessing equal education, business, and health opportunities (see Deliverable D1.1 6G Vision, use cases and key societal values). Social sustainability is about ensuring inclusive, non-discriminatory network services  that provide equal and open access to trustworthy resources and opportunities. Hexa-X aims to ‘connect the  unconnected’ and reach underserved populations, whether due to geographical remoteness or financial  constraints. “Technology can become more inclusive also by reducing its costs,” Uusitalo explains, “as, in  some cases, satellite connectivity is a cheaper way to provide coverage to underserved areas”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Economic sustainability is the ultimate check for a value-based network that achieves innovation, prosperity, and growth without creating burdens for society, the environment, or future generations. Wi-Fi natives will ride the digitalisation wave, with industries becoming ‘smarter’ and consumers wanting increasingly sophisticated  services. ""Addressing the growing demand for wireless services is a challenge,"" notes Uusitalo. “End-users expect fast, safe, and efficient networks everywhere, and meeting these expectations should not be taken for granted!”</p>

Without being perfectly accurate, they help prepare policymakers for better or worse. The <a href=""https://regroup-horizon.eu/"" target=""_blank""><strong>REGROUP</strong></a><strong> </strong> project funded under the Horizon Europe programme aims to advise the EU on how to address post-pandemic policy and institutional challenges by analysing the societal and political consequences of COVID-19 and considering the normative implications of the pandemic.</p>
","<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted significant inadequacies in global health governance, further exacerbated by an accumulation of economic, social, and institutional inequalities. However, such a crisis can also represent crucial turning points offering new prospects for political transformation. Entering a post-pandemic era, and looking back, one cannot help but note the record speed of technological advancements. And yet, the challenges of post-pandemic governance in Europe are particularly pressing and intricate, as they intersect with critical issues around the efficacy, fairness, and democratic nature of the EU's multi-level system. Furthermore, the COVID-19 crisis has underscored the importance of anticipating and preparing for future crises to establish a more robust governance framework by adopting foresight methodologies. As we look towards a post-pandemic European Union, it becomes imperative to consider how we can better manage global risks, enhance institutional and democratic resilience, and promote adaptable and proactive governance approaches.</p>
<p>Many initiatives have emerged to contribute to the revision of post-pandemic governance, including the REGROUP project funded under the Horizon Europe programme. The project gives priority to addressing the governance hindrances that have been observed during the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, it delves into other important topics that have gained significance during the pandemic. For instance, the digitalization of society has become a vital aspect of our lives and its progress has been rapidly accelerating. Lastly, the project addresses global risks and challenges that existed prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, and seeks to provide insights that can mitigate their future impact by informing strategies and actions early on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launched in October 2022, REGROUP involves a consortium of 14 universities and think-tanks led by the <strong>University of Groningen</strong>, and <strong>is organized around a three-pillar methodology: diagnosis, evaluation, and prescription. </strong>By performing a diagnosis and evaluation of EU governmental structures, it becomes possible to pinpoint their strengths and weaknesses, identify areas of improvement, and determine implications for legal and institutional benchmarks. Starting in February 2024, the findings from the diagnosis and evaluation process will inform the development of prescriptive measures, in which the foresight component will be employed. The prescriptive measures will build on research done in previous work packages and provide advice for policymakers in various forms. For example, Work Package 7 (WP7), will focus on envisioning a post-pandemic European Union, based on the legal and constitutional reflection following the <strong>Conference on the Future of Europe</strong>. WP8 addresses managing global risks from institutional and societal perspectives, and informing policymakers on how these perspectives can inform the global stage. Lastly, WP9 explores potential digital strategies for democratic resilience. Each of these packages will deliver a foresight paper, which aims to set an agenda for medium to long term (5 to 20 years) scenarios and trends. The foresight papers will also serve as a foundation for creating policy briefs that pave the way for future policy decisions and actions.</p>
<p><strong>REGROUP's foresight methodology relies on a two-step scenario building process that incorporates both thematic and temporal approaches. </strong>The first step involves the identification of empirical situations and likely trends and mapping out the socio-political dynamics and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The second step involves expanding the temporal scope to encompass a broader range of potential scenarios as the timeframe increases. As the time horizon extends, the more uncertainty is involved. <em>“Think about it as a cone,”</em> says <strong>Piero Tortola, scientific coordinator of REGROUP</strong>. <em>“We start with a narrow set of scenarios and as you go further in time, the cone expands”. </em></p>
<p>Tortola strongly believes that it is important to cultivate a culture of foresight among policymakers. <em>“The goal is not only to inform policymakers but also [foster] a context in in which policymaking is formulated on the basis of a long-view”.</em> This is even more vital in light of the constant turnover of policymakers – the aim is that even when a political mandate ends, the culture of foresight will persist. Through this persistence, Tortola adds, you could <em>“succeed in better preparing and grounding policymakers”.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While policymakers often rely on foresight as a tool, it should not be exclusively restricted to them. Tortola asserts that input from a variety of actors, such as civil society organizations and leaders, as well as citizens, is necessary for a holistic approach towards foresight. By incorporating diverse perspectives in the foresight process, policymakers can ensure that their decisions have been well-informed, based on plausible realities, and grounded on a comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand.</p>
<p>To this end, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have further underscored the critical importance of this hostilic approach to building greater resilience and preparedness to deal with future crises. As the world looks to the future, there are a number of emerging trends that carry significant risks and challenges. For example, geopolitical tensions, such as the realignment of regional blocs and the rise of new global powers, can have profound implications on the global political and economic landscape. Climate change, though not only prevalent post-pandemic, is also a major challenge, with the shift towards renewable energy sources intensifying competition between countries for new resources and markets. This, in turn, could lead to a restructuring of the global economy around nations that are major producers and exporters of clean energy technologies. It is thus essential for economic players and policymakers to anticipate future trends and build the necessary foresight to respond to them effectively. This could involve greater integration of foresight into decision-making processes, the development of better foresight methodologies, and the implementation of new tools and training programs.</p>
<p>To effectively address all future challenges, a two-fold strategy is required. We should adopt a <em>""local-to-global""</em> mindset at every step, and cultivate a robust foresight culture that includes the participation of all, from citizens to policymakers, to inform decision-making.</p>

This focus gained substantial momentum in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, where publications began framing resilience as a new compass for EU policy, underscoring the imperative to navigate challenges and transitions in a sustainable, fair, and democratic manner. At the heart of the discussions was the exploration of the genuine meaning of the notion of ""resilience"".  Attendees contemplated whether resilience is inherently tied to strength or if it manifests as a quality in the absence of strength. Participants engaged in an exploration of potential trade-offs between these diverse perspectives on resilience, prompting thoughtful consideration of whether emphasising one aspect might unintentionally diminish the significance of the other.</p>
<p>Four scenarios have been crafted by the foresight team using a matrix that considers two key axes: Economic and Technological Adaptation, and Social and Environmental Stewardship. Each of these scenarios offers a distinct portrayal of the interplay between economic, technological, social, and environmental factors:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable Breakthroughs - High Economic and Technological Adaptation, High Social and Environmental Stewardship: </strong>In this scenario, both economic and technological challenges are effectively managed, and there is a strong emphasis on promoting social equity and environmental conservation. This scenario envisions an ideal future where sustainable practices are prioritized.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Community-Compensating - Low      Economic and Technological Adaptation, High Social and Environmental      Stewardship:</strong> Despite      facing economic and technological challenges, society in this scenario      places a significant emphasis on community building, social justice, and      environmental protection. It represents a future where community-driven      efforts take precedence in addressing social and environmental concerns.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Tech-Driven Dystopia - High      Economic and Technological Adaptation, Low Social and Environmental      Stewardship:</strong> This      scenario prioritizes economic growth and technological advancements, but      unfortunately at the expense of social equity and environmental health. It      serves as a cautionary tale, portraying a tech-driven dystopia where the      pursuit of economic and technological progress neglects crucial social and      environmental considerations.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Europe in Survival Mode - Low      Economic and Technological Adaptation, Low Social and Environmental      Stewardship:</strong> In this      scenario, economic downturns and technological disruptions occur without      effective mitigation, leading to neglect in addressing social and      environmental issues. This scenario depicts a future marked by decline,      emphasizing the importance of addressing economic, social, and      environmental challenges collectively to avoid a downward trajectory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The R&amp;I policy recommendations stemming from these scenarios include strategies such as <strong>identifying and defining boundaries for the forthcoming implementation of cutting-edge technologies</strong> with a key focus on prioritizing social stability and welfare. To <strong>prevent ecosystem degradation, the team advocates for environmental stewardship,</strong> particularly through the stimulation of locally driven and bottom-up generated collaborative and innovative initiatives. Another crucial facet involves the <strong>updating of public administration and services, bringing them closer to citizens to proactively prevent institutional degradation</strong>. Additionally, the proposals emphasise the stimulation of radical innovation through ""glocal"" creative initiatives, exemplified by Living Labs, aiming to make a local impact with global significance. Furthermore, a dedicated focus on investing in resilience research was proposed, with the aim to explore new potential needs and innovative approaches.</p>
<p>During the discussions, participants actively engaged in exploring the connections between the different scenarios presented and questioning risks associated with each scenario. The conversation referred to the urban-rural dynamicsand the inclusion of rural areas in the presented scenarios with regard to resilient agricultural food systems. Participants noted that the scenarios were removed from the political landscape on Earth in 2040, specifically regarding the future geopolitical roles of countries such as China, India, and the African nations, as well as considering the evolving trajectories of the United States and the declining trends in Europe. In contrast, the discussions illuminated key insights into the interplay of resilience, community dynamics, and the broader global political outlook.</p>
<p>The coordinator of project <a href=""https://relocal.eu/"" target=""_blank"">RELOCAL </a>offered  valuable insights by reviewing the scenarios previously presented through a local lens. RELOCAL, which aimed to explore civic resilience from a local perspective, was another project that highlighted the bottom-up approach between resilience and the local community.</p>
<p>Final discussion points encompassed the crucial emphasis on <strong>the local dimension of resilience</strong>, recognizing that resilience resides fundamentally in the values of communities. The debate underscored the significant role of local values in shaping the agenda for science and technology such as in the creation of the new Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The importance of <strong>effective multilevel governance in rural areas</strong> surfaced as a pivotal factor for enhancing rural resilience. The conversation also delved into system-change theory, emphasising the need to acknowledge citizens as the smallest common denominator and integral contributors to resilience.</p>

<p>Norway is at the digital frontier in many areas. However, it needs to keep pace with rapid technological developments and competition, while improving performance in areas where it could catch up. Staying at the frontier requires agility, flexibility and well-co-ordinated digital policies. A national digital strategy can play an important role to ensure the policy framework in place makes the most of digital technologies and data for growth and well-being.<br><br>Norway has identified several underlying priorities that will shape the content and structure of its forthcoming national digital strategy: ensuring high-quality information and communications infrastructure; developing the data economy; fostering data protection and information security; increasing the digitalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises; promoting an inclusive digital society in the context of an ageing population; supporting the green transition; and digitalising the public sector. These priorities will help realise Norway’s vision of a sustainable welfare society that safeguards a safe and simple everyday life for citizens and the non-governmental sector, a strengthened business sector and a better and renewed public sector.<br><br>Norway’s digital policy landscape comprises relatively more initiatives related to Innovation than the other dimensions of the OECD Going Digital Integrated Policy Framework (the Framework), followed by Society, Access and Use. In terms of performance, Norway outperforms all OECD countries in indicators related to the effective use of digital technologies. It also outperforms the OECD and Nordic averages in societal indicators of digital transformation. Norway is above the OECD average on indicators of Trust and Access, although below the Nordic average. Norway has opportunities to catch up in indicators related to Market openness, Jobs and Innovation where there is the most potential to improve performance.<br><br>Recommendations<br>Key policy recommendations to achieve a more digital, innovative and inclusive Norway are structured around six areas:<br><br>Encourage technology adoption and skills development to ensure a more digital-intensive economy and resilient workforce. This involves promoting adoption of digital technologies among small and medium-sized enterprises and empowering people with the skills to succeed in a digital world of work.<br><br>Prioritise innovation to create a more digital Norway. This requires encouraging a culture of experimentation and risk taking, reducing regulatory burdens on start-ups and young firms, incentivising venture capital investment and support firms in scaling up, promoting investment in research and development, and harnessing the potential of “GovTech”.<br><br>Maximise the potential of data, while maintaining Norway’s strong culture of trust. This includes leveraging Norway’s culture of trust to incentivise data sharing, realising the potential of open government data to drive digital innovation, taking a multifaceted approach to monitoring and addressing cyber risks, and supporting development of data-related skills and infrastructure.<br><br>Harness the potential of digital technologies for society. This involves increasing digital inclusion through policies targeted at the groups most in need, discouraging e-waste production and encouraging e-waste recycling.<br><br>Prepare for next generation networks and a future of unlimited connectivity everywhere. This entails upgrading fixed and mobile networks to 5G and beyond, closing geographic connectivity divides by focusing on the underserved, fostering competition and reducing red tape, and supporting businesses to improve their connectivity.<br><br>Design holistic digital policies within effective governance and monitoring mechanisms. This involves using all dimensions of the Framework to design future digital policies; fostering interministerial and stakeholder co-operation in digital policy design and implementation; monitoring progress using the OECD Going Digital Toolkit as Norway’s national digital dashboard; and strengthening a whole-of-government approach to adoption of digital technologies in the public sector.</p>

Foresight processes generate insights and relationships that help communities in dealing with uncertainty. Through Foresight – so scholars argue – communities gain a richer understanding of the potential of the present and strengthen the social fabric in its ability to act upon these insights, from coping and adaptation to transformation.<br>So far goes the theory …<br>The <a href=""https://www.futures4europe.eu/project/futuresilience-obdvn"" target=""_blank"">FUTURESILIENCE project</a> has set out on a jour ney exploring foresight’s contribution to societal resilience in practice.<br>Ten “<a href=""https://futuresilience.eu/future-resilience-labs"" target=""_blank"">FUTURESILIENCE Labs</a> ” located in ten different regions across Europe have embarked on a scenario process to strengthen resilience in the face of very different challenges. In the meantime, the ten Labs are in the middle of their journey - here is a sneak preview into two of the Labs: <br>The <a href=""https://futuresilience.eu/future-resilience-labs"" target=""_blank"">IMMER</a>  Lab aims at strengthening the local resilience of mobility and energy-related activities in the cross-border Strasbourg-Kehl region. To this end, the Lab is using a science fiction-based Futures Café approach where actors from municipalities co-develop and discuss a range of science-fiction based crisis scenarios such as e.g. a Tsunami in the Rhine River Valley. In its recent <a href=""https://futuresilience.eu/news/science-fiction-way-think-future"" target=""_blank"">Futures Café workshop</a> , after exploring a range of different scenarios, the group discovered seven actions that were useful across scenarios and therefore highly likely to underpin crisis resilience.<br>The <a href=""https://futuresilience.eu/future-resilience-labs/cosight"" target=""_blank"">COSIGHT Lab</a>  is located in the German city of Hamburg. It aims to mitigate societal polarization and enhance societal resilience by increasing conflict resolution and problem-solving skills. This involves developing resilience-promoting citizen processes. To this end it is complementing an existing participatory process, the “CoSaturday”, with the FUTURESILIENCE scenario approach. <a href=""https://futuresilience.eu/news/fostering-integration-and-resilience-germany"" target=""_blank"">The first COSIGHT workshop </a> focused on the integration of migrant populations – a much-contested issue in Hamburg. The first workshop gathered more than 35 integration stakeholders from a wide range of backgrounds. Participants identified key influencing factors of integration, barriers for successful integration and tools to address these barriers. COSIGHT is now looking to transfer these findings to local policy makers.<br>Experience from these Labs seems to confirm the theoretical argument. A particular strength lies in the rich diversity of approaches. Even though the FUTURESILIENCE project provided an overarching guideline for a scenario process, each Lab interpreted this process according to the local specific requirements and capacities as IMMER and COSIGHT illustrate. As FUTURESILIENCE evolves, we will highlight further glimpses into the manifold discoveries made during the Labs’ foresight journey.  <br></p>

That was the guiding question behind Future of Sustainable Fashion, an Eye of Europe pilot workshop hosted by Helenos Consulting on January 20, 2025, at Thessaloniki’s MOMus – Museum of Modern Art. Framed by the evocative <a href=""https://www.momus.gr/en/exhibitions/syllogika-nimata-i-anna-andreeva-sto-ergostasio-metaxioy-kokkini-roza"" target=""_blank"">Collective Threads exhibition by Anna Andreeva</a> , the event invited participants to see fashion not just as style, but as a lens into the future—one that reflects our social values, ethical priorities, and growing environmental urgency. Through imagination and collaboration, citizens explored what the future of fashion might look like—and what it might reveal about the future of society itself.</p>
<p><br><strong><em>From favorite Sweaters &amp; Emotions to Fashion time travel! </em></strong><br>The workshop kicked off with something disarmingly simple: “Draw your favourite fashion item”. But the answers ran deep. Whether it was a jacket from a loved one or a vintage find, the stories converged in common values: comfort, connection, ethics, culture, and identity. Clearly, fashion isn't just about looking good—it’s a mirror for our values and our times. <br>After getting to know each other better, the five participant groups dived into fashion’s evolution by completing a three-horizon timeline—mapping the past, present, and future of the industry. They reflected on the past as an era of craftsmanship and durability, when clothing was high-quality, handmade, and often a marker of social status. The present, they noted, sends mixed signals: while fashion today allows for greater self-expression and accessibility, it also fuels overconsumption, environmental harm, and rising interest in second-hand markets and eco-conscious alternatives. Looking to the future, participants expressed hope in a more sustainable, circular fashion economy, but voiced concerns about affordability of emerging innovations like smart textiles and the safety of personal data increasingly tied to wearable tech.</p>
<p><br><strong><em>Imagine your future- design your clothes.</em></strong><br>Using a card-based game and group creativity, citizens constructed new worlds. Sometimes dystopias, other times regenerative and closer to nature, groups marched with designing fashion items that would help them adapt (or at specific cases even survive) in these imaginary futures. The results revealed bigger concerns of participants: the environmental crises and their implications on health and on humankind survival, safety, and inclusivity. <br>Across artefacts, fashion transformed from mere aesthetics into something far more powerful: a survival and adaptability tool, a connector of people and nature. Technology showed up everywhere—smart fabrics, wearable sensors, nanotech—yet always framed by a strong desire to keep things human, ethical, and grounded.</p>
<p><br><strong><em>Writing a Future’s Guide</em></strong><br>At the heart of the workshop was the Fashion Futuring Wheel—a system-thinking roadmap that connected fashion to education, politics, ESG, design, communication, and more. Citizens called for green transition in manufacturing and distribution and inclusive design. They imagined a world where transparency and safety of personal data is the norm, where AI is integrated in our lives with respect to human rights, and where fashion educates as much as it beautifies.</p>
<p><br><strong>More Than Fabric—A Force for the Future</strong><br>This workshop wasn’t just a creative exercise—it was a glimpse of fashion’s potential as a tool for resilience, identity, and systemic change. In a time of climate anxiety and digital overload, citizens showed that they’re not only ready to adapt, but to actively participate in systemic changes —with empathy, ingenuity, and vision.<br><br>See the analytical results of the workshop <a href=""https://www.futures4europe.eu/post/the-future-of-sustainable-fashion-yijr5"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. <br>&nbsp;</p>

To reach this goal, the project sees Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) playing a key role in building the capacity to anticipate, better prepare and be more flexible in crisis periods.</p>
","<p>“They’re good in a crisis” is generally considered a compliment. And it’s a characteristic that Europe is likely to need more of in the near future. ‘Crisis’ can mean a time of peril or a moment of decision. Europe has faced multiple crises in recent years, and factors such as climate change mean that they are likely to continue or even increase in frequency in the future. The challenge is not only to respond well to such crises but also to be prepared.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://futuresilience.eu/"" target=""undefined"">FUTURESILIENCE</a> project is running 10 'Future Resilience Labs', bringing stakeholders together to apply Foresight and participative methodologies. The aim is to develop evidence-based strategies that speed up the use of R&amp;I findings in building economic and social resilience.</p>
<p>Horizon Futures Watch spoke to the FUTURESILIENCE project manager, Matias Barberis of the European Future Innovation System (EFIS) Centre in Brussels, Belgium.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want to achieve with the FUTURESILIENCE project?</strong></p>
<p>We would like to contribute strengthening social and economic resilience in Europe, mobilising local communities and policymakers and highlighting the importance of valorising knowledge for putting resilience into practice. Recently, there has been a lot of public interest in the concept of resilience, even while academics were talking about it for quite some time.</p>
<p><strong>How does strategic Foresight fit into the work of the FUTURESILIENCE project?</strong></p>
<p>We focus on the vulnerabilities that are common to multiple types of crises to understand how they may evolve in the future. We aim to understand what the typically impacted areas of a society or the economy are when a crisis hits. By using scenario development, the project aims to test evidence-based policy options that will strengthen the societal fabric in different situations. We plan to develop scenarios by using different foresight tools such as weak signals or wild cards, assessing different factors that potentiate or mitigate impacts of crises in diverse areas like education, economy, finances, biodiversity or welfare.</p>
<p><strong>How do different kinds of crises contribute to social inequalities and what types of crises are you looking at?</strong></p>
<p>Societal resilience is a context-dependent concept. Crises may take place instantly or they could develop very slowly, such as an economic or political crisis. If a crisis takes place and the societal fabric is not well prepared, it will highlight all the vulnerabilities of this society. For example, inflation can have impacts on salary structures and the capacity of vulnerable groups to deal with everyday life expenses. A blackout can impact operations in a supply chain or affect transport system operations. Therefore, the idea of working in an anticipatory manner is understanding how to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen the capacity for societies to be better prepared. We don’t pretend to tackle every crisis in each pilot, but to focus on concrete societal challenges at local level (e.g. labour market, urban heat islands, health systems, housing, agriculture, etc.) and how they interact with diverse crises. The way crises are experienced and impact societies are different in each context. Moreover, we want to reduce the tendency of working in silos, as well as looking at the interdependence of crises and underlying factors.</p>
<p><strong>To what extent could foresight help mitigate future crises (or how does it fall short)?</strong></p>
<p>If you work with scenarios you can prepare for something you don’t know. Foresight can help deal with uncertainty in a more efficient way because you can be prepared for different types of options. Such an approach helps to strengthen community resilience in two ways. We can use the context scenarios to test the robustness of policies against different possible future situations. At the same time, going through the scenario process together sharpens participants‘ ability to observe the present more carefully, to notice emerging signs of crisis earlier and most importantly to mobilise collective intelligence from a wide range of perspectives to make sense of the change.</p>
<p>But foresight has a limit. If you don’t engage with the right groups of people and don’t try to anticipate their needs, then it won’t work. Generally, participative processes need to be feasible and inclusive. The project’s specific process is adapted for small- to medium-sized cities and there is still room for implementing at larger scale. However, this may pose some challenges to effective participation.</p>
<p><strong>Which actors do you aim to support for building societal resilience and how are you going to do this?</strong></p>
<p>Each pilot will start by mapping stakeholders, particularly at local level. Societal resilience as a concept is about the communities affected, not just the problem. If you work with resilience more broadly, you may need to consider communities and physical assets/infrastructures. Our project aims to focus on the societal side of resilience, with particular focus on citizen engagement and policymakers. Policy and decision makers should understand how people deal with complexities in everyday life, as well as which kinds of future people want to live in. Citizens can help framing the problems and actively participate in designing and implementing policy solutions. This increases legitimacy to build what is called community resilience.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main achievements and milestones that the project has reached so far? What are the next steps?</strong></p>
<p>In the first year of the project we will set the foundations of what we call “the experimentation phase”, in which 10 pilots will implement the project approach. The final 10 pilot cases will be announced mid-December 2023.</p>
<p>We are also developing a toolbox that includes process and policy tools: stakeholder analysis, foresight methods for developing scenarios and testing policies.  The toolbox also includes a suite of thematic tools, each tailored to address specific or interrelated challenges and crises across various sectors, such as health, agriculture, finance, climate change, and disaster management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The second product is a knowledge base compiling EU-funded research results and policy recommendations from international organizations. It aims to bolster local resilience and capacity, adding value to existing knowledge and supporting the science-to-policy process. Both the toolbox and the  knowledge base will be openly available in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>In an ideal world, how would you expect the future of resilience to develop in the next 20 years? What is your vision?</strong></p>
<p>There should be more awareness on the need to work on resilience and facilitate the uptake of existing science-based solutions for increasing preparedness in a complex and uncertain world. The topic should permeate all levels of society and there should be more engagement in understanding what resilience means in different contexts.</p>

It is a defining feature. Strategic foresight has become a critical capability for navigating complexity, enabling decision-makers to anticipate change, surface emerging risks, and imagine alternative futures. At this inflection point, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a profound augmentation to how we conduct foresight, but not a replacement. In this context, the Policy Foresight Unit of the European Parliamentary Research Service has recently published “<a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2025/774665/EPRS_BRI(2025)774665_EN.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Augmented foresight: The transformative power of generative AI for anticipatory governance </a> ”.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear. AI cannot foresee the future. It does not reason with intent or understand human values. What it can do is dramatically increase our speed, scale, and scope in making sense of potential futures, if used judiciously and critically.</p>
<p><strong>The cognitive extension of human futures thinking</strong></p>
<p>Generative AI can be understood as a cognitive prosthetic, a tool that extends human perception, memory, and pattern recognition. LLMs excel at identifying latent patterns in unstructured data, surfacing weak signals, and generating coherent narratives based on probabilistic inference. These capacities are particularly useful in exploratory foresight, where practitioners seek to widen the aperture of plausible futures. That is why, at 4CF we have created 4CF Sprawlr - the next-generation AI-powered debate and ideation platform designed to transform the way we brainstorm, strategize, and make decisions, as well as to challenge the assumptions of participants.</p>
<p>Moreover, during horizon scanning, LLMs can process thousands of documents across domains in real-time, clustering insights, filtering noise, and flagging emergent issues. This ability to synthesize vast and diverse information ecosystems supports faster and more responsive foresight cycles. But raw data synthesis is not foresight. True anticipatory intelligence requires contextual judgment, ethical discernment, and interpretive framing, capacities that remain uniquely human.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative construction and scenario intelligence</strong></p>
<p>Scenario planning, a cornerstone of foresight, benefits from AI in powerful ways. GenAI can help identify key drivers, test interdependencies, and co-develop scenarios that are internally consistent and plausibly disruptive. When used in parallel (“AI swarms”), different models can triangulate and refine assumptions, improving narrative robustness.<br>From a cognitive science perspective, LLMs excel at narrative generation because human cognition is fundamentally narrative-driven. We make sense of complex information by constructing stories, and AI's narrative fluency can mirror and support this innate process. However, plausibility does not equal probability or desirability, and this is where human oversight is critical.<br>Moreover, GenAI can model second- and third-order effects, encouraging deeper exploration of cascading impacts. But it struggles with ambiguity and values-laden trade-offs, areas where human foresight is indispensable.</p>
<p><strong>New frontiers</strong></p>
<p>One of the most intriguing applications of GenAI in foresight is the use of generative agents, simulated personas capable of expressing realistic, contextually grounded responses. These tools can be embedded in scenario narratives to create dynamic, dialogical futures. Emerging research shows that synthetic respondents can replicate human survey responses with high fidelity in controlled environments. They enable simulations of behavioral dynamics in policymaking, urban planning, or public health where direct access to participants is limited. Yet, the epistemic status of these agents remains debated. Are they truly proxies for human complexity, or merely statistical echoes? Their outputs must be seen as exploratory artifacts, not empirical evidence, informing, but not determining, foresight conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Bias, blind spots, and the illusion of objectivity</strong></p>
<p>Despite their capabilities, LLMs come with significant epistemological risks. Their training data is historically bounded and socioculturally skewed. Without critical intervention, they risk amplifying dominant worldviews and suppressing marginalized perspectives, exactly the opposite of what good foresight should do. This reinforces what foresight scholars have long argued: that the future is not a neutral space, but one shaped by power, values, and competing imaginaries. AI outputs can reflect and reproduce systemic biases unless de-biased through intentional prompt design, algorithmic transparency, and participatory governance frameworks.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fluency of LLM-generated text can create a false sense of authority, leading to overreliance or reduced critical engagement. Practitioners must remain reflexive and iterative, treating AI outputs as inputs for dialogue, not doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>Augmented intelligence, not artificial intuition<br></strong><br>There’s a philosophical tension at the heart of this conversation. Foresight is not merely an analytical process, it is also a normative, imaginative, and ethical act. It involves asking: What kind of future do we want? Whose futures are we considering? What trade-offs are we willing to make? Generative AI does not possess values. It does not dream, hope, or fear. These are deeply human faculties, and they are essential to meaningful foresight. That said, when used well, GenAI can be a strategic co-pilot: accelerating discovery, enabling richer scenario exploration, and expanding access to foresight methods across disciplines and organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Co-evolving with the machine</strong></p>
<p>In sum, the integration of GenAI into foresight practice should be viewed not as a technological leap, but as a sociotechnical evolution. The most effective foresight processes will be those that combine human insight, ethical reasoning, and narrative richness with the analytic power and generative capabilities of AI. To paraphrase a growing sentiment: the future will not be written by AI alone, but by humans who know how to work with it wisely. The real promise of GenAI lies in partnership, not replacement. Because while AI may help us see further, it is still up to us to choose the path, interpret the terrain, and navigate uncertainty with courage, care, and imagination.</p>

","<p>This is the central question in our scenario process with our expert group and guests. In the current phase, we are developing the socioeconomic/-political scenarios that will significantly impact what a European energy system based on abundant hydrogen could look like. In a series of interviews at the beginning of the scenario process, we identified the following six key factors: (1) Global Power Constellations; (2) European Integration and Cohesion; (3) The Degree of Autonomy and Self-Sufficiency in Europe; (4) The Focus of European and Global Policy; (5) The Values, Preferences, and Sustainability of Lifestyles; and (6) the Organisation of Energy Systems. Currently, we are exploring in more detail how these factors can shape the energy system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does the (primary) renewable energy come from? Is it produced within Europe? Does it come from imports? Or is it a mix of both imports and production?</li>
<li>How is hydrogen transported to and within Europe?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Is hydrogen produced more centrally and then transported? Or mostly decentral? Are there differences between cities and rural areas?</li>
<li>How much industrial production will be taking place in Europe, and how concentrated will it be regionally?</li>
<li>What are the end uses of hydrogen? Furthermore, how much hydrogen is needed?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, one can easily imagine that hydrogen production needs to happen in Europe if the trade is restricted due to conflicts. Consequently, the question is how much energy is available (and needed) in such a Europe. The answer to this question depends on the energy consumption of the industry, transport, and households and the rate of investments in renewable energy infrastructure. Energy sufficiency, in this case, might very well be a political decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following paragraphs present the socioeconomic/-political scenarios that the experts have developed. The possible configurations of an energy system for each scenario will be presented in a subsequent report. Some presented future developments are more likely than others, some are already visible today, and some are preferable. In total, we cannot predict or forecast the exact future. We can explore various potential futures to find the correct answers to support the developments we want to see in the future and prevent those that we consider undesirable.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of the resulting scenarios</strong></p>
<p>Based on a morphological analysis with a consistency check, we identified four specific scenarios:&nbsp;</p>
","<p><strong>I The United States of Europe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ia Primacy of sustainability – circularity with high tech</strong></p>
<p>The world took climate change seriously. The United Nations are recognised as a sort of world government. The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the European Union is extended to nearly all policy domains and strengthened on all levels (legislation, executive/law enforcement, jurisdiction on central, regional and national levels). National governments have transferred power to the European level and their regions. European nations amongst themselves cooperate politically and economically in a very integrated way. The former primacy of “economic development and growth” has now turned into “sustainability and circular economy”. As a result, some large transnational companies focused on industrial production struggled and went bankrupt because investing in environmentally friendly production was too expensive. This consolidation of industrial production has led to a reorientation of markets towards digital services, recycling industries, and technological innovation, including research on new materials and furthering efficiency. Material cycles are mostly closed, and the material turnover is strongly reduced. Consequently, the input of new raw materials is barely necessary. Europe is widely autonomous and self-sufficient both in terms of materials and energy. While global trade is possible, import and export rates are relatively low.</p>
","<p><strong>Ib-Forced sustainability – circularity based on frugality</strong></p>
<p>The former bipolarity between East and West does not exist any more. Western dominance declined due to internal conflicts within the United States. Russia and China have allied. New power centres emerged around India, Brazil, South Africa, and the US is trying to regain influence. This reconfiguration provoked ever-returning conflicts in various regions of the world. Global trade is limited as a result of conflict and terror. European countries moved closer together and strengthened the European Commission as a European government that takes care of common security, foreign affairs and sustainability policy. European nations are focussing on a single European market. Means of a circular economy – recycling, reusing, reducing, refurbishing, refusing, etc. – are widely applied to most of the sufficiently abundant resources in Europe that impact the well-being of its citizens. Local orientation, appropriate and affordable technologies, and intra-European trade play a key role in the well-being and content of society's living. This shift in orientation implied the adaptation of certain societal habits (travelling less, changing consumption patterns, eating more local/regional food, etc.) leading to a “purpose-economy”. The means of the Green Deal are the guiding principle of European regulation and politics. Only that the focus is not on economic integration but on the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability as formulated in the Green Deal. The economy is oriented towards an efficient exchange of goods and services, as opposed to (financial) growth. Europe is mainly autonomous and based on a renewable energy system. Emissions trading and carbon border adjustment mechanisms combined with other due diligence mechanisms underpin the focus of environmentally friendly and climate-protective economic activities.<br><br></p>
","<p><strong>II Economisation – Primacy of the Price</strong></p>
<p><strong>A privatised world</strong></p>
<p>Large multinational companies dominate the world. They have their security and supervision installations and even private military services. As they have more financial power at their disposal than some single nations, they have large lobbying capacities and a remarkable influence on political decisions. A significant share of infrastructure and terrain is privatised, causing citizens, other (smaller) companies, and partly states to be highly dependent on large companies. The European Union as we know it today does not exist any more. Most European countries have negotiated bilateral agreements to assure trade and secure peace. The EU Commission still exists in a consolidated form in the function of an advisory council – comparable to the United Nations. Global markets are highly efficient, and global agreements between multinational companies assure perfect global distribution of raw materials and goods. The whole economy follows the principle of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The multinational companies recognised environmental threats and “no action” prices early. Therefore, high environmental standards were implemented quickly because the negotiation and legislation processes are lengthy. The level of pollution decreased significantly worldwide. Societies’ values are oriented towards material status and consumption. Nonetheless, the private company-owned leasing and renting systems enable sustainable and affordable solutions for society, ensuring high living standards.</p>
","<p><strong>III Green Deal for Europe</strong></p>
<p><strong>A western led world</strong></p>
<p>The US and the Western countries (G7) remain the global economic and technological leaders. China and Russia seek to cooperate, and multiple agreements are in place to ensure that conflicts remain few. Trade with China and Russia is restricted, creating shortages of certain raw materials. The policy of the EU Commission is ambitious, setting far-reaching goals for various political themes. The priorities are environmental and climate policy. Nonetheless, the administrative apparatus is large and slow in decision-making. The interests of various countries vary significantly. Despite that, Europe is internationally strong, and its policies are effective. Europe is technologically advanced and applies recycling as well as other circular economy means, like reusing and refurbishing techniques. The economy is strongly based on research and innovation, and technology transfer, enabling a circular economy on a global scale. High-tech, constant innovations, new materials and digitalisation help achieve energy and material efficiency, relieving the pressure on the environment and supporting healthy lifestyles. European policy is focused on the European single market. Emissions trading and carbon border adjustment mechanisms combined with other due diligence mechanisms underpin the focus of Europe's environmentally friendly and climate-protective economic activities. These mechanisms, together with global technology transfer, assure global trade.</p>

","<p>Presentations:<br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Michal Pazour </strong>(TC Prague, Czech Republic) introduced the Eye of Europe project and the context of this second Mutual Learning Event.</li>
<li>Moderator of the event <strong>Lenka Hebáková</strong> (TC Prague, Czech Republic) followed up with an introduction to the event’s aims and agenda.</li>
<li><strong>Mikko Dufva</strong> (SITRA, Finland) – “Communicating foresight. From knowing it all to empowering change”. The presentation included three case studies: SITRA’s decade long experience with megatrends as a platform for dialogue, their work on weak signals as an invitation to broaden futures thinking in a “what if?” spirit and, finally, their efforts to empower others to define futures bottom-up, through small funding to diverse teams across Finland.</li>
<li>“Communicating foresight in the European Commission” presented by <strong>Maia Knutti</strong> and <strong>Teodora Garbovan</strong> (EU Policy Lab, European Commission) brought insights into how, in the European Commission context, foresight is employed and linked with the policy cycle. Examples covered foresight content (e.g. Strategic Foresight Reports) and engagement tools (e.g. megatrends hub, scenario exploration system) that are serving different stakeholder groups across multiple channels.</li>
<li><strong>Bianca Dragomir</strong> (Institutul de Prospectiva, Romania) discussed a case study on embedding foresight into policy making in the context of developing the Strategy for Fishing and Aquaculture 2035 in Romania. Moreover, she shared about embedding foresight into both policy making and societal conversation, discussing two Foresight on Demand projects: Scenarios on “Transhumanist Revolutions” and foresight-meets-speculative-design project “Futures Garden”.</li>
<li><strong>Totti Könnölä</strong> (Insight Foresight Institute, Spain) shared about the Foresight on Demand project ""European R&amp;I foresight and public engagement for Horizon Europe"" that advanced several objectives: generating foresight intelligence, i.e. through forward-looking policy briefs; monitoring of foresight activities and providing support for exploitation (Horizon Futures Watch); laying the building blocks for a European foresight community supported by an online platform.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Marie Ségur</strong> (Futuribles, France) presented a case study on “Future of social work in France to 2035-2050” and the methods employed throughout the process: using surveys to motivate engagement with futures thinking, scenario building that may inform strategic choices and guide towards a vision and, finally, communicating outcomes in a synthetic manner, that may contribute to a wider discussion around the topic.</li>
<li>Eye of Europe project coordinator <strong>Radu Gheorghiu</strong> (UEFISCDI, Romania) shared previews of the upcoming upgrade of the futures4europe.eu platform, with its new look and extended features.<br><br>This event is the second in <strong>a series of five MLEs planned in the project</strong>; <strong>the following event will be held on January 21st 2025 also in an online format</strong>. All Eye of Europe MLEs are organized by Technology Centre Prague (TC), Eye of Europe partner and key Czech national think tank and academia based NGO with a rich experience with knowledge-based policy making support and (participatory as well as expert based) foresight activities.</li>

To re-duce their impact, it is becoming increasingly vital to anticipate their course.</p>","<p>The Observatory of the Europol Innovation Lab (EIL) monitors technological developments, anticipates potential future scenarios, and performs foresight with the intent to foster innovative practices in law enforcement. Horizon Future Watch asked Mark Wittfoth, who is responsible for the Observatory, and his colleague, Diederik Don, for their views on the role of foresight for the future of law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>How does strategic foresight fit into the work of the Europol Innovation Lab and Europol as a whole?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> The mandate of the Innovation Lab is to identify, promote, and develop concrete innovative solutions that benefit EU law enforcement. Our team was set up to help anticipate and detect relevant emerging technological developments, so that we can identify weak signals and help Europol and the wider EU law enforcement better prepare as the developments occur.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of research is the EIL currently undertaking in the field of strategic foresight?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark: </strong>One of the things we do is technology scanning; we look at emerging technologies and try to assess the impact they will have on the law enforcement community, both in terms of the benefits as well as the threats from criminal abuse. Our most recent in-depth report was on the impact of large language models such as ChatGPT. Together with our operational experts we tried to assess the impact that this type of technology can have on law enforcement, how they might use it, how criminals can abuse it, and this will likely keep us busy for the coming years as the technology progresses. We are planning to do a more in-depth technology scan in the second half of the year, where we try to and rank technological developments based on the impact that we anticipate that they will have on law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>How do these technologies make us rethink about the way we define crime and how to tackle it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diederik</strong>: I think the most important thing to note is that crime itself is as old as humanity, but the technology and the way in which it is committed is different. We try to apply our understanding of the approach to crimes with what these new technologies might enable.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Historically, criminals have always been among the earliest adopters of new technologies. Criminals are not bound by regulation or restrictions. They are very creative and looking for new ways, as Diederik said, to carry out the same types of crime just in different contexts or facilitated by technology. Again, using the ChatGPT example, within weeks after publication of the tool, there were some criminals already posting on dark web forums how one can use ChatGPT to carry out some basic cyber-criminal activity. This shows how quickly these technologies are applied. Importantly, we need to understand the technology to grasp how it can be abused, but at the same time, we also need to be able to use the same technology to investigate crimes, to analyse our data and become more effective, to keep up with changing landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the most salient trends that have been identified in your strategic foresight activities that you believe will have an impact on your work until 2030?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> I think we will move away from AI being considered a singular technology, but something that really enhances and facilitates many other types of technological developments. In terms of how we can use it for law enforcement, there are numerous use cases that AI can help us with, but also how criminals might be able to abuse AI tools and new advances in, for example the area of generative AI, such as deepfakes. Another area that is not clearly defined is mixed reality, and we see that recently there is quite a lot of movement in that market. The tech sector is still investing a lot of money into this technology, and I personally believe all it takes is one breakthrough like we saw with ChatGPT and it becomes something that you know will become universal in society and consequently the demand will increase.</p>
<p><strong>What mechanisms does the Innovation Lab have in place to engage with various stakeholders?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> We work very closely with the Member States across the entire range of our tasks, liaising with key subject matter experts from the national competent authorities. As such, we are working with experts from law enforcement on issues such as horizon scanning and foresight, in which we can learn from each other’s expertise and pool resources. In addition, the Europol Innovation Lab is part of the EU innovation Hub for International Security. From there, we talk to other agencies such as Frontex, the JRC, the Asylum Agency, Eurojust, and the European Commission, so it is key for us to foster this collaborative aspect. The various stakeholders that we work with in foresight help to anticipate both positive as well as negative developments. We also maintain communication and collaboration with other entities in the internal security domain. Although we observe similar issues, our perspectives and priorities may differ, enriching our collective understanding and approach. This is a key added benefit of working within this network of different networks. If we identify a joint priority, then we might have a foresight report on it, for example innovative developments in the area of encryption or in privacy enhancing technologies. Then, each member contributes to the collective foresight thinking with their own work. So, we really try to share information, build up expertise collectively, and ensure that not everyone is doing the same thing separately.</p>
<p><strong>As technologies become increasingly accessible, the risks of criminal misuse may also rise. How does the Europol Innovation Lab collaborate with law enforcement and security agencies to pre-emptively mitigate risks?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Our aim is to anticipate potential threats so that we can already today take the necessary steps to prevent or mitigate undesirable future scenarios. But we are also working on the more strategic level. For example, we discuss the ethical use of technology, not just the risks from criminals, but also how we as law enforcement can ensure that we consider all necessary ethical considerations when we're using technology. Our mandate is to serve the public, and for us to do so efficiently, we need to ensure that the public trusts us to protect their fundamental rights. So, it’s important for us to make sure that the ethical component has a really strong role, both in how we use technology but also in how we talk about technology. We encourage these types of debates and we try to be also role models in terms of having these on top of our agenda in the law enforcement community.</p>
<p><strong>Diederik:</strong> Foresight is only really useful if you really do something with the outcomes. You have the information, but you need to make it actionable, and this is one of the challenges. We're lucky that we have a network of experts that are doing foresight in the Member States. Our mission is then to concretise the work and try to implement the future scenarios that we anticipate. That can only be done if we work together.</p>

The project is conducted by the “Foresight on Demand” Consortium on behalf of the European Commission, DG RTD. In a Deep Dive area “Climate change and R&amp;I: from social change to geoengineering”, together with the other members of the expert team, I am developing, among others, this 'green dream' scenario. Get involved, comment on the scenario and relate the scenario to recent developments!</p>
","<p><strong>Scenario dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Strong global governance; Sustainable lifestyles; Adverse to risk-taking; Vigorous activism</p>
<p><strong>Impact and risk areas</strong></p>
<p>In 2040, global warming stays below 1.3C above pre-industrial levels and is expected to stabilised below 1.5C. While this is resulting in broadly moderate changes and risks in the existing climate, in some areas like coral reefs and glaciers impacts are severe. Hazards in Europe are mostly visible in key exposure areas, such as cities, and settlements in low-lying areas, affecting key infrastructure. Hazards include moderate sea level rise and increased heatwaves that affect human health and the agricultural sector. Climate risks assessments are regularly employed to assess how much adaptation is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Demographics, economy and governance</strong></p>
<p>High levels of mitigation and adaptation are driven by the EU strategic shift towards sustainable energy autonomy, accelerated by the war in Ukraine in the early 2020s. Climate policy is also strongly driven by member states and regional authorities, particularly in higher-risk areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guidelines issued for European businesses, such as the EU Taxonomy and ESG investments have heavily influenced and steered businesses towards more sustainable practices for several decades. This has encouraged European climate business to grow and lead the global markets, supported by decades of joint research and development towards just transitions. The EU has been successful in leading global governance efforts in climate policy and major powers like the US and China have joined forces to push other lagging countries to strengthen the commitments. The countries have also ratified the Global Carbon Tax Agreement and the precautionary Pact for Common Geoengineering Mechanism. The former aims to alleviate past injustices by using proceeds for restorative climate and development measures globally. The latter provides the forum to discuss geoengineering approaches in an transparent way. All this is backed by international financial cooperation for mitigation and adaptation, ensuring also funds for developing countries. The EU celebrates its ten-year anniversary of banning investments in fossil fuel-based assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the EU, the institutional redesign has drawn heavily on the principles of just transition and climate justice, building wide support for climate action. At the local level, citizen assemblies are a common way of engaging people. EU-wide Climate Barometer+, a deliberative policy tool which gauges European public opinion and is rarely ignored when decisions are made in terms of climate policy. It is employed Unionwide at regular intervals to gauge the public opinion and acceptability of climate policy. These include risk acceptance surveys of climate policy (strategy and implementation), and although the results are not legally binding, they nevertheless raise the level of compliance of policies across the Union. Acceptance of risk continues to be low, steering the options towards the “precautionary principle” and also screening out some climate solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Practices and technologies</strong></p>
<p>Official climate policies have taken up many initiatives of civil movements, among others flexible and or shorter work weeks, promotion of shared housing and plant-based diets. Furthermore, the focus on responsible research and innovation to ensure social acceptability of new practices and technologies have supported the rapid diffusion of prosumer schemes of urban farming and renewable energy micro-grids and mobility, for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrated systemic approaches building on synergies between adaptation and mitigation and sustainability more broadly have created green, liveable and walkable cities, and neighbourhoods. European public-private partnerships are ‘exporting’ this know-how, widely requested across the world with supported social innovations and mechanisms of deliberative democracy for informed decision-making regarding climate.</p>
<p>The EU climate policy portfolio also includes some less risky geoengineering options. In accordance with the new Common Geoengineering Mechanism, the EU is championing international pilots on ocean alkalinization and de-desertification and directing significant investments in biochar, extensive peatland and wetland restoration across the EU and scaling up permaculture and agroforestry practices. Acceptability of new geoengineering options is gauged through deliberative tools before they are piloted. The social and environmental impacts of any new geoengineering are assessed based on the Directive for NBS (for mitigation, adaptation and carbon removal), which sets effective standards and mechanisms to prevent undesirable side-impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyles and activism</strong></p>
<p>In Europe, people have become highly aware of the climate crisis and, even if they feel personally less vulnerable to changes, they stay committed to climate action through demonstrations, boycotts and witnessing and watching, as well as influencing through consumer choice and shareholder activism. These social movements have jointly contributed to the general outlook and preferences in lifestyles that emphasise frugality and sustainability, translating into shifts towards more sustainable mobility, housing and working.</p>

"Reflections from the 2025 Futures Conference","[""cc31afc1-a304-465a-be3e-a887b68884f3""]","reflections-from-the-2025-futures-conference-97lei","[""bb6d79aa-1062-45eb-b889-1f509e9db78d""]","[""bb6d79aa-1062-45eb-b889-1f509e9db78d""]",,"[""ec5ce12c-0abf-4e5f-8bbf-e92a39ad12d6""]",,,"[""4a24fbff-eab7-4ad8-b686-dbc8bfd0a495""]","b208913c-d666-4226-bfa9-aaf03cd80655",,"[""bb6d79aa-1062-45eb-b889-1f509e9db78d""]",,,,,,"<p><em>The 25th Futures Conference focused on the futures of technologies, their development, importance, role and risks as a driver of social change. A record number of 330+ participants from more than 35 different countries met up in Turku (Finland) to discuss the effects of social and environmental changes on technological development and vice versa.</em></p>
","<p>I have been asked to provide a brief summary of my key takeaways from the well-attended conference. This is not an easy task. As with in any conference with many parallel tracks - here, as many as seven sessions were underway during the same time - one could not help to leave with the feeling that one had missed many things, that many discussions had been unfolding in spaces that one could not (also) be present in, and that any conference experience by default may be more individual than reflecting all participants. A conference is thus a wonderful reminder that we are living in a world not only of multiple futures, but also consisting of multiple presents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below, therefore, is not so much the takeaways from the 2025 Futures Conference as <strong><em>my </em></strong><strong>takeaways from </strong><strong><em>my </em></strong><strong>2025 Futures Conference </strong>presented with an emphasis of what might interest European foresight communities:</p>
<p><strong>The foresight community is growing - and becoming more diverse<br></strong>As the record number of participants, and the incredibly diverse set of papers and presentations, documented, the interest in foresight and futures studies is at a remarkable high. It also attracts new groups of people - policymakers, corporate representatives, technology specialists, and defense and military organisations were all represented within the conference. It was clear that the current state of the world highlights the importance of navigating uncertainties, and that for many groups perceived technological transformations raises as many questions as answers at the moment. On a personal note, I was happy to help organize a panel discussion featuring high-level Finnish life science industry representatives - and that these took time out of their calendars to attend an academic futures conference sent a key signal of how they value foresight and technology foresight at this present moment.&nbsp;</p>
","<p><strong>European policy foresight is advancing <br></strong>Several presentations also outlined the many ongoing foresight-related activities across Europe. Besides presentations from academics and foresight practitioners, the conference in Turku featured inputs from the European Commission, from the Joint Research Centre (JRC), and from the European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA) which have become a<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eudrugsagency_eudaforesight-futuresliteracy-futurereadyeu-activity-7339209295978291200-Zkg3/"" target=""_blank""> leading light amongst EU institutions  in utilizing and advancing foresight</a>  as a key part of policy development.</p>
<p><strong>Futures of Technologies? AI<br></strong>Perhaps it is not surprising that a 2025 conference on Futures of Technologies saw plenty of discussion about topics related to Artificial Intelligence. This was the focal point for several keynotes, including Director of the Millennium Project Dr. Jerome Glenn, whose call for global anticipatory governance of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) before it's too late reverberated through the conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
","<p></p>
","<p><strong>Defense and security a big part of our presents<br></strong>Another major takeaway that said much about the state of the world in 2025 was the emphasis on defense and security issues. This emphasis was clear from the list of attendees, from the presentations, and from the corridoor discussions throughout. Keynote speaker <strong>Elina Hiltunen</strong> set an inspiring start for this, as she discussed how military organisations can learn from weak signals presented in science fiction literature.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Against Blank Slate Futuring<br></strong>Finally, with so much talk (not least in society at large) about the uncertainties in the current world environment, it was refreshing to hear keynote <strong>Cynthia Selin</strong>'s call against 'blank slate futuring'. During her keynote, she underlined how important it is for scenario work to consider not only key uncertainties, but also certainties and the stickiness of elements unlikely to change. As she noted, ""<em>the future is not a blank state, but cranky and crammed</em>"" and a better understanding of this allows also for better understanding of what <em>can</em> be changed and how. Along these lines, she also warned that futurists (and people in general) should beware when new forms of lock-in emerges that constraints our futures. With a conference full of discussions on technological development (e.g. AI), it was hard not to see her words as a reminder of the dangers of unreflected lock-in caused by technological determinism.</p>

Hydrogen is the smallest and lightest molecule in the world. It is about eight times lighter than methane. There's a lot of methane leakage around the world. And by <em>""a lot""</em>, I really mean a lot. Satellite imagery by the European Space Agency collected data that proves there is significantly more leakage in the atmosphere than official estimates. And methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere (Source: Environmental Defense Fund - EDF). Some of this methane leakage is due to sheer industry negligence (oil and gas companies have been proven to do routine gas flaring), but also to bad casings, old pipes, and all sorts of infrastructure mishaps that are bound to happen in any industry. Now imagine how much easier is for hydrogen - a much lighter molecule than methane - to escape and leak, particularly when we blend it with natural gas in existing pipelines, as is the case in the plans of many countries in Europe - including Romania, my home country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
","<p>What's the scientific evidence to date of the potential environmental consequences of methane leakage? EDF lab studies have shown that hydrogen leakage is, in the best case, around 1% but could go up to as much as 10%. And a 10% leak could lead to 0.1°C or 0.4°C increases, the scientists claim. And this is because hydrogen has an indirect global warming effect by extending the lifetime of other GHGs (Fan et al., 2022). UK-based scientific evidence brings about even more worrisome figures: hydrogen may have a 100-year global warming potential of about 11 times greater than carbon dioxide (Warwick et al., 2022). Compared to the warming it is trying to abate by displacing fossil fuels, it turns out that in a high leakage scenario, ""hydrogen emissions could yield nearly twice as much warming in the first five years after replacing its fossil fuel counterparts."" On the other hand, if leaks are minimal, the climate benefits are consistent - an 80% decrease in warming compared to fossil fuels over the same period of time. The danger is real, it seems, even in the case of green hydrogen, let alone in the case of blue hydrogen, where the combo between methane leaks and hydrogen leaks could be a truly deadly cocktail for the planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leakage is assumed to be lowest in industrial on-site usage and highest in the production process, followed by transportation and delivery, while not enough data is available for the end-use leakage. Specialists believe that measures such as designing new hydrogen infrastructure with a focus on leakage prevention and penalising leakage where it does occur, alongside focusing on incentivizing hydrogen in so-called ""hubs"" (industrial sites where it is both produced and consumed), to the detriment of decentralized usage (e.g., in heating and transportation), can still keep hydrogen a climate ally rather than a climate foe (Koch Blank et al., 2022).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research on these topics is still in its infancy, with most of the peer-reviewed reports released in 2022. It is clear that intense further research is needed on leakage risks, mitigation strategies, and warming effects. At the same time, however, as the ""hydrogen rush"" is already moving ahead at full speed in the EU, it's probably worth introducing strong safeguards from the very beginning, in parallel to the advance of sciences:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>prioritise green over any other colour of hydrogen</li>
<li>prioritise hydrogen in sectors where it can be easily produced and consumed onsite (and which are hard to decarbonize to start with, like the fertilizer industry or steel production) and deploy hydrogen at scale in other sectors (e.g.: transportation, heating) later. This probably makes sense from a basic business planning perspective, too.&nbsp;</li>
<li>create new infrastructure for hydrogen, and don't retrofit old pipes that leak.&nbsp;</li>
<li>put in place the highest level industry standards for leakage prevention&nbsp;</li>
<li>unlike methane, where many jurisdictions are still not taxing leakage with hydrogen; let's not repeat the mistakes of the past, and let's design a leakage penalty system from the very beginning.</li>

The overarching goal of the project was to support the<br>reflections of the Mission Board from a forward-looking perspective.</p>
<p>The team of experts was set up by the ‘Foresight on Demand’ consortium to provide the Board with wellversed<br>expertise in both foresight methodology as well as thematic developments on the future of<br>oceans and water. The objective was to think along with the board and to stimulate the debates by<br>raising surprising and challenging issues based on forward-looking analysis and exploration. The project<br>provided the Mission Board with new information, (systemic) insights and/or alternative future visions<br>that connect the extremely multi-dimensioned topics tackled by this Mission Board.</p>
<p>The project had started with the scoping phase of identifying focal areas of which results were discussed<br>in the meeting with the Mission Board. Subsequently, the foresight team explored further future<br>uncertainties and knowledge gaps via a real-time Delhi survey to stakeholders. The scoping phase<br>began with the scanning of 33 foresight reports looking towards 2050, foresight databases and news<br>feeds to address long-term developments and emerging signals of change. In particular, the foresight<br>expert team developed five focal areas, which were presented to the Mission Board to provide<br>interconnected insights as well as challenging and provocative ideas to enrich their work. The five focal<br>areas are summarised in the table below:</p>
","<p>After the initial phase of scanning and analysing emerging issues and synthesising the findings into five<br>focal areas the results were discussed with the Mission Board. In the meeting the discussion led the<br>Mission Board request the foresight team to continue the foresight work and identify further data and<br>knowledge gaps related to oceans and waters, the recovery of oceans and waters and their role in<br>climate change mitigation.</p>
<p>In line with foresight practice as well as with the Mission Board’s explicit desire to involve a wider public,<br>the study engaged stakeholders via a real-time Delphi method highly suitable to address future<br>uncertainties. The Delphi method is a structured group communication process, dealing with subjects,<br>on which often unsure and incomplete knowledge is available, that are judged upon by experts. The<br>idea is that the respondents can learn from the views of others, without being unduly influenced by the<br>hierarchies or other societal structures and power relations.<br>Invitations to the survey were sent to stakeholder groups in different sectors of society, in particular:<br>research and development, policy, industry and civil society. Approx. 3000 European stakeholders were<br>invited. The survey platform was open two weeks in February 2020 leading to the total of 238 registered<br><strong>participants of which 138 finished the survey</strong>.</p>
<p>Participants assessed the total of 15 future statements and proposed new ones to be considered by the<br>Mission Board, in three areas: i) oceans and other water ecosystems, ii) the recovery of healthy oceans<br>and waters and iii) the role of oceans and waters in climate mitigation. The results of the assessments<br>presented in mean values are summarised in the following table in each of the three areas.</p>
","<p>The findings form the survey can be summarised on each of the areas as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oceans and other water ecosystems</strong>: In this area, all proposed issues are accepted as<br>important but, with the current attitude towards marine and water ecosystems, respondents<br>believed that actions will not be sustained properly. The reason for this lack of consistency<br>between “right things to do” and what is actually done probably resides in cultural gaps that<br>make it difficult to pass from theoretical analyses and legislation to action, with the reversal of<br>current trends. Nonetheless,<strong> the survey indicates consensus about the adoption of the<br>ecosystem approach, recognising that humans, with their cultural diversity, are an<br>integral component of ecosystems </strong>and emphasizing the need for collaboration between the<br>scientific community, the economic sector, policymakers and the public at large.</li>
<li><strong>The recovery of healthy oceans and waters</strong>: In this area, the survey showed a remarkable<br>consistency, from all stakeholders, on the actions contributing to healthy oceans and waters.<br>This point could almost guarantee the success of the mission as it seems that the society<br>understands the enormous contribution of healthy oceans and waters on the planet earth.<br>Although the list of what can be achieved in the near future could be endless, the fact that we<br>have <strong>to include society at large in addressing challenges</strong>, should be our first step.</li>
<li><strong>The role of oceans and waters in climate mitigation</strong>: The respondents provided a global<br>impression that Europe can be leader in several fields of climate mitigation. If, however, the<br>rest of the world is not addressing these efforts of climate mitigation, the role of Europe will not<br>have significant impact. There is no single major technological solution that, alone, would curb<br>the climate change, a goal that might be achieved by a mix of technologies and regulations, at<br>the right geographic scale, and as early as possible. Furthermore, positive and negative<br>impacts of each technology have to be assessed carefully as very little is still known on the<br>mid-term and long-term impacts of the different technologies available today. <strong>Much more<br>research and stakeholder cooperation are required to select the right technologies and<br>the optimum strategies on time</strong>, in order to avoid unmanageable trends.</li>
<li><strong>Further areas to be explored</strong>: Next to the topics proposed by the foresight expert team,<br>stakeholders were asked to suggest other topics that should be understood better and acted<br>upon in the EU. Three main topics emerged: <strong>research and research infrastructure, civil<br>society, and corporate social responsibility</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final remarks and recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The first part of the foresight study led to the descriptions of five possible focal areas for European<br>innovation action in the realm of oceans and waters: 1. Climate-resilient coastlines, 2. Clean water for<br>the blue planet, 3. Vital aquatic ecosystems, 4. Open digital twin of oceans and waters, 5. Humans at<br>sea. All these focal areas have similar magnitudes, notably if we consider an extensive view of ""humans<br>at sea"" not only as an island network but as a continuum between a vulnerable and densely populated<br>low elevation zone and a potentially harmful but also rich coastal ocean. In view of addressing the focal<br>areas or their elements in the future actions towards sustainable development in Europe, it is worth<br>prioritising such efforts in relation with the general theory of systems that establishes the hierarchy of<br>systems in three spheres showing that human activities and economy are nested into natural systems<br>and must obey their laws. Traditional illustrations of sustainability, however, show only a small overlap<br>of the three spheres, this overlap representing sustainability.</p>
<p>The real-time Delphi survey confirmed that there is a need for a holistic approach leading to more<br>structured actions. This is widely recognized but seldom satisfied. Too specific actions, undertaken while<br>ignoring the behaviour of the rest of the ecosystems, may lead to temporary success but will surely not<br>improve the overall situation. This calls for enhanced efforts in improving ocean literacy at all levels,<br>from the scientific community (too focused on reductionistic approaches) to the economic, social and<br>industrial sectors. Furthermore, the conceptual landscape embracing water ecosystems (linking oceanic<br>and inland waters) is very fragmented, with the high risk that while fixing specific problems other<br>problems are created. Hence, we conclude with three recommendations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adopt a holistic approach for balanced actions that calls for improving water literacy at all<br>levels of society.</li>
<li>Create networks of interest using a common (not too technical) language embracing water<br>ecosystems (including both oceanic and inland waters) to overcome fragmentation in society.</li>
<li>Conduct holistic impact assessments and establish monitoring mechanisms of measures<br>implemented to fix specific problems to avoid creating in parallel new problems in complex<br>ecosystems.</li>

This is the intriguing question at the heart of <a href=""https://relocal.eu/"" target=""_blank"">RELOCAL</a>, an EU -funded Horizon 2020 research project that ran between 2016 - 2021.</p>
","<p>In efforts to preserve the wellbeing of local communities, anticipating, preparing for, and adapting to economic, social, and environmental challenges and changes is key for civic resilience. In this context, Project RELOCAL wanted to explore the intricate relationship between local needs and European frameworks, aiming to enhance civic resilience through better accessibility and articulation of local demands. Imagine a tapestry of diverse cities and regions, each weaving their unique patterns of spatial justice. RELOCAL wanted to understand the trajectories these communities follow to transform European opportunities into local successes, how future trends could impact these trajectories, and where there could be areas of improvement.</p>
<p>“First, we were interested in exploring the concept of spacial justice,” says Petri Kahila, former project coordinator and Institute Director of the University of Eastern Finland. “Secondly, its relationship with cohesion as a key goal of the EU to target disparities across levels of development of various cities and regions.”</p>
<p>The consortium was also motivated by the need to concentrate on the challenges and opportunities that local areas face in the context of the globalisation, migration, and climate change. “Spatial justice should lead to fair and equitable distribution of resources and opportunities across different European spaces. We were keen to examine how these two concepts are interconnected and how they can be achieved.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civic resilience serves a dual role in the context of spatial justice: it not only identifies opportunities for transformative change, but also reveals aspects susceptible to resistance. On one hand, it acts as a response to spatial injustices, with communities mobilising their resources and capabilities to overcome challenges and enhance their living conditions. On the other hand, as communities adopt strategies to bolster their resilience, they may unintentionally reinforce existing power dynamics and inequalities, thus contributing to the very disparities they seek to overcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Let’s take the case of the Stockholm Commission,” says Kahila. “It was established to promote sustainable urban development and to decrease social segregation in the city of Stockholm. But some critics stipulated that it had been dominated by elite interests and did not take into account the voices of the marginalised.” It was thus taken as a case study to analyse its effectiveness and areas for further development to overcome these limitations.</p>
<p>Through a place-based approach, RELOCAL examined 33 case studies across European regions and cities with specific challenges to be tackled, such as improving governance processes, counteracting isolation and remoteness, and renewing structures, to name a few. Through imagining different futures, and actions they might lead to achieve spatial justice, it further identified plausible changes in spatial justice across various locations for the medium term (2030). This was done through a combination of theory-of-change elements and scenario elaboration, whereby contextual conditions for every case study were identified and scenarios were defined according to different nexuses of change with varying degrees of uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, one of the nexuses identified was ‘demographic changes’, which encompassed two opposing trends related to population dynamics (shrinkage-growth) and population distribution (urban vs. rural). Each nexus then generated four ‘states’, or combinations, which stakeholders were invited to use as a framework to define scenarios for each case study. The megatrend of demographic ageing, for example, has socio-economic implications such as reduced levels of economic activity and an increase in social exclusion, and the necessity to implement necessary policy responses.</p>
<p>“The purpose of these scenarios was to explore the complex ways in which spatial justice is influencing and can be influenced by different factors and contexts in various regions. It was also to provide a creative tool for the stakeholders to reflect their current situation and future aspirations,” says Kahila.</p>
<p>The project has produced recommendations  on improving spatial justice and community wellbeing through place-based initiatives. For effective decision-making in specific regions, Kahila stresses the need for a comprehensive understanding of spatial justice at all levels of governance, not just locally. This requires a robust approach that emphasises participation and collaboration. Establishing various platforms for dialogue is crucial to facilitate this involvement. Some of these initiatives may take up to 10 years to fully realise, underscoring the commitment needed for long-term, sustainable change. Kahila wishes to see a stronger participatory and collaborative approach, not only with the public authorities, but also with civil society organisations, the private sector, academia, and most of all, residents and citizens.</p>

The newly published Eye of Europe report ""Showcasing Perspectives: A Stocktaking of R&amp;I Foresight Practices in Europe"" provides an assessment of just that, namely the actors, preferred methodologies, success factors and bottlenecks for effective R&amp;I foresight projects, as well as trends for future R&amp;I foresight projects in Europe.</p>
","<p>This stocktaking, carried out by the DLR Projektträger in the framework of the Eye of Europe project, is based on a comprehensive survey of 43 R&amp;I foresight organisations in 16 ERA and four non-ERA countries. Interviews with renowned national foresight experts complement the findings. Similar response rates from government and academia, business and other organisations such as consultancies or NGOs allowed for a diverse snapshot of R&amp;I foresight approaches in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Highlighting flagship projects</strong></p>
<p>For the preparation of the study, European foresight actors submitted 54 different R&amp;I foresight projects. These include projects that aim to anticipate technological and societal changes in order to inform national and regional R&amp;I strategies and make them more robust, or foresight projects that address complex global issues such as climate change, cancer or sustainable food security. Others seek to understand new developments, such as the digital transformation, and analyse the social and economic impact of these changes, or to develop and design new products.</p>
<p>R&amp;I foresight projects are not only carried out at European and national level. The report additionally highlights sub-national champions such as the Friuli Venezia Giulia region and Sardinia in Italy, the Helsinki-Uusimaa region in Finland, Ostbelgien and the Flemish government in Belgium, or Hauts-de-France, to show how they have used foresight methods to advance their R&amp;I agendas.</p>
<p><strong>What are critical success factors and bottlenecks for R&amp;I foresight projects in Europe?</strong></p>
<p>Here is what the R&amp;I foresight experts believe contributed to the success of their projects: Top of the list of critical success factors - mentioned by almost all respondents - is high-level commitment and support from government representatives. Ensuring cross-sectoral stakeholder engagement was another frequently cited factor. Leveraging existing networks or databases of expertise was also cited as a critical success factor, as it enables the rapid mobilisation of the right experts. But how can we ensure that we reach the relevant people and keep them engaged?</p>
<p>Several R&amp;I foresight experts stressed the importance of defining and communicating a clear purpose for the project and explaining why it is important and worth stakeholders' time, as well as demonstrating that foresight can add value in the context of today's R&amp;I challenges. What can foresight achieve and what are its limitations? Transparency of methods also contributes to credibility. Facilitating direct interaction between participants in creative settings has the potential to be beneficial, allowing for more dynamic and contextually rich foresight outcomes. The R&amp;I foresight experts noted that it is important to allow sufficient time for interactive discussions. Wherever possible, the setting should be face-to-face.</p>
<p>Yet, these R&amp;I foresight projects have not always gone to plan. Bottlenecks identified include recurring ones such as insufficient time for comprehensive analysis and stakeholder engagement, or financial constraints that can prevent in-depth trend analysis and essential foresight activities. It can also be time-consuming to mobilise a diverse group of experts and policy-makers for participatory exercises, which can be a challenge in a time-critical project. Short-term thinking and a reluctance to challenge established beliefs can hinder the exploration of alternative futures and stifle innovative foresight efforts. Others reported the ""impact gap"" and their struggle to ensure that foresight results influence decision making, often exacerbated by an over-reliance on written summaries that lack engaging communication methods. Finally, maintaining objectivity in horizon-scanning activities and avoiding the pitfalls of techno-optimism can also be challenging.</p>
<p><strong>What's next? Trends in R&amp;I foresight</strong></p>
<p>The report provides answers to those curious about the new frontiers and trends in the use of R&amp;I foresight. Whether it's the integration of AI and machine learning technologies into foresight practices, the representation of future generations and nature in foresight processes, speculative and design-based approaches or debiasing techniques, the methods of R&amp;I foresight are constantly evolving.</p>
<p>For those wishing to expand their networks, the report also provides an overview of international and European (R&amp;I) foresight networks, national (R&amp;I) foresight networks, networks focusing on technology assessment, and examples of regular (R&amp;I) foresight conferences or conferences with sessions dedicated to R&amp;I foresight.</p>
<p>This stocktaking report is a snapshot of the status quo of R&amp;I foresight actors in Europe. However, new innovative projects are being implemented as you read this article. As the Eye of Europe project consortium, we are committed to strengthening fora for exchange among R&amp;I practitioners interested in foresight methodologies. Let's continue the lively discussions on the Futures4Europe platform to shape tomorrow's R&amp;I agendas together.</p>

Luxembourg Strategy's core accomplishment is ‘ECO2050’ – a strategic economic vision for Luxembourg by 2050, published in Sept. 2023 and funded by the Ministry of the Economy. To ensure its relevance, the vision is adaptable to varying economic growth and population projections and to other similar countries than Luxembourg. It prioritises a balance between technological, natural and social solutions, while fostering private sector participation alongside public investment.</p>
","<p>This vision anticipates three possible future scenarios – Socio-economic Sleepwalking, Bio-regional Circularity and Techno-digital Optimism – alongside a potential disruptive wildcard, the ‘Red Queen’ scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the core, it argues in favour of a human-centered, nature-positive economy, with business-led clean technologies and climate adapted infrastructures and carbon services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Foresight Vision ECO2050 is structured in 10 building blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strategic autonomy</strong> since boosting domestic production reduces dependence on imports and decouples the economy from shocks on international markets&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Circularity and sufficiency</strong> since saving energy and raw materials makes it easier to keep with environmental and financial constraints&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Focusing on people, knowledge and wellbeing</strong> since societal and organisational innovation creates new businesses, attracts talent and preserves a high quality of life&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reconciling the digital, ecological and social transitions</strong> since building a competitive economy that manages the environmental and social footprint of new technologies facilitates social and ecological progress&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Critical redundancy and strategic storage </strong>capacity since duplicating solutions and building up reserves of essential goods and services ensures greater resilience and adaptability for the economy&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Administrative simplification</strong> since improving the environment for entrepreneurs, investors and researchers by streamlining procedures boosts the economy by making it more agile&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Economic diversification</strong> since adapting key sectors to new challenges in the name of the general interest strengthens the preservation of common goods and the capacity of the existing economic system to turn transitions into business opportunities&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable economic diplomacy</strong> since forging close diplomatic and commercial ties with partners who share the same ecological and social values creates synergies of strengths and assets, while cementing the global governance of resources&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable and solid public finances</strong> since guarding against budget imbalances will help financing transitions and efforts towards greater sustainability&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Anticipation and speed </strong>since planning for the long term, constantly adapting to increasingly rapid change and keeping an eye on developments gives a comparative economic advantage by defusing threats and reinforcing opportunities.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The <ins>governance</ins> of the ECO2050 foresight process was as diverse and rich as was possible with the means at the disposal of Luxembourg Strategy and concerned 1300 persons, encompassing public administrations, national thematic observatories, research, business, federations, municipalities, citizens, youth organisations, foresight experts...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luxembourg Stratégie greatly benefited from <ins>international support</ins> from the EU Commission Vice-President for Foresight Maroš Šefčovič's team and the SG Foresight Unit, the OECD SG Foresight Unit, as well as from France Stratégie and Futuribles.

","<p>On 16 August 2023, the European Environment Agency (EEA) <a href=""https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/horizon-scanning-tips"" target=""undefined"">published</a> the practical guide 'Horizon Scanning – Tips and Tricks.' This publication is produced by the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET), which is a partnership network of the EEA involving 38 cooperating countries. Working closely with the EEA, EIONET is responsible for collecting and developing data, knowledge, and advice for policymakers regarding Europe's environment.</p>
<p>The guide offers step-by-step support on how to frame, run, analyse, and communicate the results of a systematic horizon scan for practitioners with different professional backgrounds and levels of experience. It presents a practical methodology structured into four key steps: Signal Spotting, Signal Scanning, Sense Making and Communication. The publication was designed with the aim of enhancing and developing the capabilities of the 38 countries within the EIONET Network to conduct foresight exercises, particularly horizon scanning. According to Richard Filcak, Head of Group Systems, Foresight, and SOER at the European Environment Agency: “After a couple of years of experience with horizon scanning, we had the feeling that we had a lot of things to share. This publication was an attempt to systematically bring together bits and pieces of information, practices and tips and tricks.”</p>
<p>While the guide's primary focus remains directed at environmental stakeholders, its scope goes beyond just the <a href=""https://www.eionet.europa.eu/"" target=""_blank"">EIONET Network</a>, as it may also be valuable to individuals and organisations outside the network that specialise in foresight practices. This publication assumes greater practical significance amid a rising demand for foresight, fuelled in part by the European Commission's commitment to incorporate foresight methodologies into policy formulation and response strategies.</p>
<p>The guide also highlights the importance of addressing cognitive biases and underlying assumptions in the process of Horizon Scanning. These biases and assumptions wield significant influence over one's capacity to detect weak signals, navigate future possibilities, assess the present, and interpret the past.</p>
<p>Filcak noted that the effectiveness of Horizon Scanning is also closely tied to the diversity and inclusivity of the expert group involved. A more diverse group of experts can broaden perspectives and consider various angles, thus breaking silo thinking. As Filcak highlights, “Sometimes, it takes just one person within the group to introduce provocative questions and alternative viewpoints that can change the entire dynamic”.</p>
<p>When contemplating the future, Filcak questioned the potential limitations of horizon scanning when spotting potential causes of uncertainty in complex interplay between climate change, socio-economic disparities, and technological advancements. As he stated: “My worry would be if these horizon scanning techniques are sufficient to determine key risks and opportunities requiring attention, while we face more and more complicated questions. Foresight methods provide interesting inputs, but I think we are moving in circles with a couple of methodologies which have been in use for 10, 15 or more years. The question is whether you can think out-of-the box in terms of new approaches and methodologies.”</p>
<p>For him, one emerging field in foresight is the “combination of both quantitative and qualitative techniques, with an emphasis on building connections between environmental, social, and economic indicators and finding effective ways to translate them into models.”</p>

Notably, it marks a transition from fragmented project-based foresight to a more integrated and sustained foresight infrastructure within the EU’s research and innovation systems. The conference is also a living lab for the kind of futures we want to see: inclusive, reflexive, care-centered, and critically engaged, and thus reflecting the efforts of the Eye of Europe project.</p>
<p>Our gratitude extends to all who contributed to this conference— authors, reviewers, and conveners—for their intellectual generosity and for pushing the boundaries of what foresight can be. The diversity of themes, methods, and perspectives presented here is a testament to a foresight community that is not only growing, but maturing— anchored in practice, but not afraid to question its own foundations.<br></p>
<p>As you read through these abstracts, we invite you not just to absorb insights, but to engage with them—challenge them, expand them, remix them. Because the future of Europe will be co-created not by prediction, but by participation, imagination, and shared responsibility.<br></p>
<p>Let this book be an invitation to that ongoing process.</p>

The topic proved rich in discussion points, challenges, and questions related to the future.</p>
","<p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are typically viewed as a cornerstone for innovation, because they facilitate knowledge transactions that might otherwise be hindered due to the public good nature of knowledge. Thus IPR are seen as crucial in promoting creative and inventive activities. However, some critics argue that IPR can be a costly market distortion, inhibiting rather than encouraging innovation. IPR institutions are increasingly under scrutiny amidst evolving innovation trends and changes. IPR, known for their technical complexity and variability across legal jurisdictions, are facing diverse challenges, reflecting the dynamic nature of modern innovation and innovation policy. Amongst the important shifts are trends towards more inclusive, open innovation processes involving various stakeholders and the growing influence of digitalization.</p>
<p>The presentation of scenarios relating to the future of intellectual property was the cue for participants, speakers, and experts alike to begin teasing out the underlying implications of IP for innovation and patenting. The scenarios evolved along important emerging trends and were mapped along two dimensions: private versus public use of IP, and concentration of power versus distribution of power. These dimensions, along with a definition of key drivers and main actors, yielded the following five scenarios:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>End of IP as we know it – </strong>Key actors are large cloud-based giants and trade secrets are a prevalent form of IP. Europe loses value as tech giants are not based in Europe. Unitary patent loses meaning. Policy implications: anti-trust and ex-ante regulation are of utmost importance to avoid obscured private governance of IP.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>‘Creative destruction’ of the IP regime – </strong>Drivers include the speed of technological change, increasing technological complexity, and disruptive technologies. Europe faces regulatory challenges. Regarding policy implications, the aim is to maintain the quality of IPR and IP authorities are encouraged to operate in the public interest.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>IP a battlefield of geopolitics – </strong>EU hands out strong security patents within a harmonized IPR regime. In regulation, mandatory mediation is paramount and the mediator has access to agreements from patent owner.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Global and balanced IP for open innovation – </strong>IP is lean toward access. Drivers include public interest, global IP, and the movement of public goods. AI and digitalization play a role in ensuring transparency, monitoring, and innovation. Science has become the solution to address extreme weather events. Public funding ensures that there is open access to public research results.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Open-source collaboration globalized innovation – </strong>Innovation is driven by collaborative communities and startups. There is capacity to regulate access to EU internal market and influence global supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audience offered commentary and discussed the individual scenarios. One participant noted that several scenarios focused primarily on IP and innovation from a techno-centric perspective, suggesting a need for greater emphasis on the social context of innovation. A point was made about how the fourth scenario, which dealt with global and balanced IP, better addressed this aspect by highlighting the implications of patents for public good in the context of COVID. One of the projects presented subsequently, <a href=""https://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/projects/creative-intellectual-property-rights/about/index.html"" target=""_self"">Creative IPR</a>, further touched upon these implications for the creative industries, namely pointing to the impact of the COVID crisis on revenue generated from copyrights, particularly for the music sector. The project coordinator argued that the pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of the music industry due to a heavier reliance on copyright for revenue compared to a more resilient sector, such as fashion design and textiles. This raised questions about how to best support the music industry through IP in times of crisis.</p>
<p>Touching upon the technological implications for IP, a representative from the World Intellectual Property Organisation (<a href=""https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html"" target=""_self"">WIPO</a>), argued that human contribution to innovation will not be replaced by AI, but that a lot of AI applications rely on training data, which still makes use of human creativity. He argued that in Europe, one area that has seen the strongest progress is digital technology, at the expense of more traditional technologies such as mechanical, chemical, and technical engineering, which have witnessed a reduced number of patent filings. On the other hand, he stressed how the fastest growth in patent development in East Asia questions how European companies should prepare for a changing landscape in innovation reflected in intellectual property.</p>
<p>One remark in reaction to this was a caution not to forget traditional technologies, and not to assume that these would be overshadowed by aspects such as digitalization, but to continue fostering this strength in traditional technologies. While Europe is a follower in the area of digitalisation, AI-generated products are still driven by human creativity and engineering, highlighting the importance for regulators not to forget about this link.</p>
<p>Referencing the fourth scenario, another participant argued that countries in East Asia, such as India, which advocate for more access, may contribute to a changing geopolitical landscape towards access, fostered by national trade interests. Focusing more on production and less on usage could lead to duplicating many existing patents. At the same time, this approach might also entail increased international collaboration and bilateral relations, pooling resources to accelerate innovation.</p>
<p>The overall discussion highlighted the need to strike a balance between innovation incentives and the right to access. It is essential to find a middle ground that encourages creative and scientific advancement while ensuring information and educational resources remain accessible to all.</p>

It is simultaneously instrumental to the green and digital transition and exposed to its effects. A steady supply of (green) chemicals is required to deploy renewable energy generators, insulate Europe’s building stock and create reusable and recyclable consumer goods. On the other hand, chemical synthesis is an energy-intensive process inherently dependent on carbon-based feedstock (currently derived almost exclusively from fossil fuels). In addition, chemistry is a global industry with international value chains, where the EU both collaborates and competes with other countries for materials, knowledge and skills. Transforming the European chemical industry into a sustainable motor for the green and digital transition will require investments in infrastructure, assets and skills. Focus should be placed on chemicals that are crucial to this Twin Transition, Europe’s resilience, or both. The long lead time required for the deployment of infrastructure and the development of skills means that such investments must be made now to achieve targets set for 2050. In connection with these issues, the report at hand aims to give insights into a number of value chains that are strategic to EU economy. It considers which chemicals and innovations are vital to transforming these value chains as well as rendering them more resilient and future-fit. To this end, a participatory workshop-based foresight approach was implemented to provide a unique set of insights from stakeholders and translate them into actions and policy recommendations.</p>

In the workshops, Eye of Europe partners will apply both established and novel Foresight approaches to dive deep into topics of common interest to stakeholders across the European Research Area. These workshops will take place in cities such as Madrid, Prague, Berlin, Bucharest, Paris and Thessaloniki, as well as online. <br><br>The final set of topics for EoE pilot workshops is as follows:<br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Democracy – a long term Project</strong>: This online workshop will gather domain experts to shed light on a large spectrum of future challenges to democracy.</li>
<li><strong>The Knowledge of our Civilisation(s) in 2040</strong>: In this two-day Berlin based workshop participants with diverse domain expertise will explore the future of knowledge in human civilisation in the face of multiple drivers of change.</li>
<li><strong>European Industrial Decarbonisation</strong>: This two-day workshop in Madrid will gather diverse stakeholders to debate alternative pathways of industrial decarbonisation for Europe in the face of different geopolitical scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Emotion Ecosystems</strong>: This Bucharest based two-day workshop will investigate the impact of technologies like affective computing and brain-machine interface on individuals and collectives with different stakeholder groups.</li>
<li><strong>Democracy and Technology</strong>: In this workshop citizens in Prague will jointly reflect on democratic approaches to risks connected with new technologies and their impacts on various societal groups.</li>
<li><strong>Aging and Assisted Living Technologies</strong>: This workshop in Berlin with international research and policy actors is dedicated to future ways of integrating smart and digital technologies into assisted living and care for older adults.</li>
<li><strong>Fashion Futures</strong>: In two Thessaloniki based workshops citizens and domain experts will explore the future of sustainable fashion in interaction with values and identities both with a regional and international perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Public Policy and Change of Diets</strong>: In this workshop in Paris a diverse group of citizens will reflect on policy inroads into future pathways towards healthy and sustainable diets.</li>
<li><strong>Science and Conflicts</strong>: In this online workshop, experts and actors of the science system will jointly dive into possible implications of growing geopolitical tensions for science.</li>
<li><strong>Future of Knowledge and Emotions</strong>: This futures survey will provide input for the two interrelated topics the future of knowledge and the future of emotion ecosystems that will feed the respective workshops.<br><br><br>These Eye of Europe Foresight pilot workshops have a twofold purpose.<br><br>First of all, the workshops serve the project’s aspirations expressed by Eye of Europe coordinator, Radu Gheorghiu, namely to  nurture the “vibrant community of individuals engaging in a conversation about our collective future” and to fuel the “continuous loop of dialogue, learning and inspiration”.<br><br>Secondly, by addressing topics of common interest to R&amp;I actors across ERA and major R&amp;I challenges, they aim to mobilise collective anticipatory intelligence. In particular, we hope to shed light on the evolution of research and innovation and its contribution to a wide range of important future questions.<br><br>How did the team arrive at these topics?<br><br>The topic generation process involved three major elements:<br></li>
<li>Analysis of R&amp;I strategy documents from a range of different EU countries</li>
<li>interviews with R&amp;I actors from different positions in ERA’s research and innovation ecosystem,</li>
<li>and interactive discourse among EoE partner organisations.<br><br>It was important to the topic identification team, led by Pier Francesco Moretti from CNR - Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Italy, not to remain at the surface of the challenges that are expressed in key documents but to dive deeper into underlying root causes and dynamics. So when in the document analysis, topics like energy, artificial intelligence, digitalisation, health and security emerged at top positions, we strived to identify crosscutting underlying aspects.</li>

<p>In a world in flux, short-term firefighting often takes priority in organisations, in businesses and even in our own lives. In this context, thinking about the future can often feel nebulous and intangible. Measuring progress towards distant horizons can feel less relevant to the here and now. Data to inform long-term decision making can be scarce. Avoiding the perils of institutional ‘group think’ becomes a secondary priority, especially when time is tight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
","<p>Defending against this mindset is what our Future.Ctrl online course is all about. Delivering positive futures in a time of global uncertainty and massive technological change makes it all the more important. <br><br>Future.Ctrl shows how we translate futures and foresight into real-world delivery. Our online course provides an <strong>actionable and practical toolkit</strong> based on the methodology we have successfully used with governments and organisations around the world to deliver positive futures. It encourages learners to approach the future with curiosity, drawing on creative, comparative and critical ways of thinking to explore what might come next. <br> <br><strong>Future.Ctrl methodology </strong><br><br>ForgeFront has developed a new futures technique that combines (i) <strong>futures thinking</strong>, (ii) <strong>probability-based quantitative forecasting</strong>, and (iii) <strong>decision-making</strong>.  <br><br>In a novel six-step methodology, it uses <strong>Superforecasters</strong>Ⓡ from Good Judgment Inc to forecast the probability of scenario-based events via forecasting questions. A framework for decision makers is then established to select actions if a forecasted probability exceeded a forecasted threshold (e.g. 50% likelihood by 2050).  <br><br>This enables decision-makers to: <br>-&gt; Supercharge preparedness by pre-agreeing actions before a threshold has been passed;  <br>-&gt; Move more quickly when crisis hits (as decisions have already been made); <br>-&gt; Ready delivery partners in advance;  <br>-&gt; Make better choices during ‘steady state’ moments, rather than poor ones during times of crisis.  <br><br>Overall, decision-makers gain an understanding of the futures they might experience over a given time horizon, quantitative data about the likelihood of events and possible actions.  <br><br><strong>Future.Ctrl online course overview </strong><br><br>Following the technique’s successful implementation across governments and organisations, we developed an online course to enable individuals, policymakers and foresight practitioners to replicate this methodology and connect futures thinking, forecasting, and policy design. <br><br>You’ll learn how to: <br>- Anticipate and stress-test future risks and opportunities <br>- Build actionable, evidence-based strategies <br>- Design policy recommendations that actually get implemented <br>- Link long-term foresight to short-term decisions with clarity and rigour  <br><br>The course is packaged into <strong>8 modules</strong> and <strong>46 lessons</strong> you can access at your own pace; expect:  <br>✅ Practical ‘how to’ guides, video tutorials and real-world case studies  <br>✅ Hands-on exercises, consolidation quizzes and downloadable resources  <br>✅ Future.Ctrl Foundation Accreditation, complete with a certificate.<br><br>Get in touch if you would like to know more or hear directly from ForgeFront’s Directors, Gavin Moore or Sam Douglas-Bate, and their experience advising UK government. <br><br>Available now exclusively at our new website https://forgefront.co.uk/online-course  <br><br>&nbsp;</p>

Anticipating potential future scarcities will help policymakers shape the transformation to a climate-neutral economy.</p>
<p>Working with stakeholders from industry, policymaking and society, the project developed three future narratives:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first, “New Players and Systems”, new companies and entrepreneurs come into the energy system with new technologies, bridging the divide between utilities and customers, changing both supply and demand in a more decentralised system.</li>
<li>The second, called “Incumbents' Renewal”, assumes fossil fuel companies and big utilities adapt by pivoting towards renewable energy and carbon capture and storage. This supply-side transition would imply less infrastructure and consumer change.</li>
<li>The third, “Efficiency and Sufficiency”, projects a future where lifestyles change to prioritise energy and resource efficiency, as well as health and non-material well-being.</li>
</ul>
<p>These narratives were then translated into the quantitative scenarios accessible via the LCPP tool, using a combination of energy system models. “One model was run concerned with the electrification of industry,” says Professor Ekins. “Another model was concerned with the co-benefits of the CO2-reduction pathway through the reduction of air pollution.”</p>
<p>The project found that across all strategies and models, there are “no-regret” options, such as accelerated renewables deployment, increased electrification across all sectors, and bringing carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies and e-fuels to maturity.</p>
<p>“They all came up with more or less the same macroeconomic picture,” says Professor Ekins. “They all suggested there would be only a very small reduction in GDP growth, one so small that it wouldn’t be noticeable, and in most countries, you actually get a positive economic outcome if you put monetary values on the improvements in air quality that go along with reduced use of fossil fuels.”</p>
<p>Each narrative has different implications for the technologies and therefore the skills needed in the workforce: the “New Players and Systems” scenario is centred on renewable technologies, battery-electric vehicles, and heat pumps; “Incumbents’ Renewal” focuses on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), nuclear power and synthetic and bio-based fuels; circular economy and lifestyle changes are the main drivers behind “Efficiency and Sufficiency”.</p>
<p>“We had a specific work programme on the issue of green skills,” Professor Ekins says, “Obviously there are some technologies which will be much more used in some pathways than others.”</p>
<p>The project produced a policy brief on decarbonisation’s impact on labour markets and skills. In particular, the team found that increases in energy prices will tend to favour employees with technical skills rather than manual workers, and while this may have large effects on employment in individual firms, it is likely to have less effect for the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>“When you’re talking about getting to net zero, every single economic sector will need to decarbonise,” emphasises Professor Ekins, “and many of the skills that they will use to decarbonise will be the same skills they use at the moment.”</p>
<p>Even the switch from a diesel to a hydrogen bus would demand many of the same skills – from the manufacturing of the vehicle’s body to driving it in service. The biggest differences would be in the engine and infrastructure, although even here, “many of the skills that you would use to redesign the bus are very similar to the skills that you would use to design a diesel one”, he says.</p>
<p>Overall, while the project found that barriers to decarbonisation are not insurmountable, no matter the pathway, portions of the workforce would indeed need new skills. The European Green Deal should therefore make significant provision for retraining, taking account of the nature of workers’ existing skills and the distribution of green industries across EU countries and regions. Based on US experience, the project also concluded that green subsidies are more effective in regions with the appropriate green skills.</p>
<p>By examining different potential scenarios for future decarbonisation, and analysing the associated challenges and benefits, INNOPATHS is helping policymakers make informed steps towards a climate-neutral future.</p>

In the midst of this turmoil, the EU is confronted with finding a proper position and redefining its policies, its foreign, as well as internal relations. There is a chance for a proactive new neighborhood policy. Will the EU seize the momentum?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
","<p>In 2022, the post-cold war world order, which very much determined the inner state of European affairs as well as the EU’s position on the geopolitical scene, appears to be shaken by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A new divide is tearing the European continent apart: the EU and its allies in defense of democratic and pluralistic values on the one side and an authoritarian and autocratic regime threatening these values on the other. This disruption might even go beyond Europe if new international blocs and confrontations emerge. The threat concerns not only traditional values but also lives and material prosperity. Moreover, not only do these sudden changes push the EU to take a military stance by providing weapons to Ukraine and reconsidering its own defense capabilities but they must also be seen against the background of an accelerating climate crisis. While the impacts of climate change threaten many regions in the EU directly, they also put more indirect pressure on migration and the economy. The war in Ukraine is fueling the drivers of climate change, and therefore, many Europeans are torn between contradictory moods: indifference and solidarity; fragmentation and cohesion; empowerment and desperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another factor that affects the EU greatly is the US foreign policy. Will the US continue its military dominance in Europe, delivering military weapons, personnel, and intelligence, as well as pursuing its own interests in Eastern Europe, or will it take a post-hegemonic position and withdraw from the European continent, leaving the conflicts to be solved by EU and the rest of NATO? Domestic developments in the US can have tremendous effects on geopolitics. This uncertainty feeds the fear of the future and gives rise to the weaponization of everything and the new geo-political realism: budget increases for deterrence and budget cuts on social-political topics. Accompanying energy shortages and reversing climate-neutral energy policies are contributing to an economic crisis and the social division of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past months have turned many future visions and prospects upside down: those who had expected modern wars to be fought mainly with and against autonomous and AI-based weapon systems coupled with comprehensive disinformation campaigns were taught a lesson. While material battles wear out old-fashioned weapons systems and pointlessly cost human lives, cyber wars are fought at all fronts, and deep fake has become a fact with social media, thus instantiating the phenomenon of hybrid warfare, a term coined back in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A central question of the near and long-term future is: what will the geo-political power distribution look like? Will Europe succeed in the geopolitical struggle for agency? And if so, at what price? Are there any new global leaders in sight, and will they be able to guarantee global peace, democratic values, and economic prosperity? What will be the role of international institutions? Does diplomacy have a chance? What are the perspectives outside of the EU and Europe? Will there be future options for pathways to collaborate in order to avoid conflagration all over the planet? What can be the role of the EU? Will the EU be able to install an intelligent and strategic neighborhood policy to enlarge the belt of democracies around it through diplomatic, economic, and military ties? These and other questions were explored in our workshop following a 3-time-horizon foresight approach: the resulting four scenarios will be discussed in the upcoming blog posts. Meanwhile, we are looking forward to hearing your thoughts - please comment on these questions in the sections below!</p>

The reach of airborne pathogens and persistence of aerosolized particles suspended in the air are a significant concern for the spread of pandemic and seasonal respiratory diseases. This is particularly relevant in indoor spaces where most respiratory infections occur. Controlling the transmission of airborne pathogens is therefore a cornerstone of public health efforts to manage and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ensuring safety and health for individuals and communities. Technologies that allow such control are essential to address the challenge.</p>
<p><br>This report is the output of a comprehensive study which evaluates the potential of the current technology landscape for suppressing indoor airborne pathogen transmission. The analysis outlines two main technology groups: those for detecting airborne pathogens and those for decontaminating air and surfaces. It identifies several key technologies in each group, and assesses their maturity, impact, and potential priority for funding. It outlines the drivers, enablers, and barriers for the development and adoption of these technologies, providing insights into factors that may influence their future implementation. It also explores forward-looking perspectives with scenarios for future health crises and offers recommendations for policy and research to address the challenges and leverage the opportunities in the field of indoor air quality.</p>

<p>In Scenario A, European Civic Ecovillages pursue self-sufficiency and contribute to establishing a cooperative, locally oriented, caring economy restoring the ecosystem carrying capacities in land and sea. In Scenario B on Sustainable High-tech Europe, European businesses enjoy global leadership in regenerative and multi-functional high-tech solutions for energy, aquaculture and agriculture. In Scenario C on the United States of Europe, centrally planned Europe is divided between intensive use of land and sea and large conservation areas. Scenario D on European Permacrisis portrays Europe in a post-growth and politically scattered context that leads to low rates of innovation and fragmented use of land and sea. Each scenario considers i) Economy and technology, ii) Demographics, lifestyles and values, iii) Governance and iv) Environment.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario A – European Civic Ecovillages</strong></p>
<p>It is 2050. In the face of the intensifying climate emergency and the concomitant frequent crises, ensuring survival for current and future generations has become the prime policy goal in Europe. Europe strives to achieve self-sufficiency in terms of essential products, food, materials and energy. The economy is predominantly characterised by cooperative prosumption patterns. The locally oriented caring economy is nurturing quality of life across the whole territory. The health of ecosystems has become a top priority across all policy fields. Spatial planning is looking at land and marine areas in an integrated manner. It is focused on restoring ecosystems through multifunctional regenerative production practices that nourish biodiversity both on land and at sea. Extractive practices that are harming ecosystems are abandoned or at least limited to absolute necessity and a multitude of regenerative agroecology practices are tested and implemented across Europe. Many ecosystems have gradually recovered. The shift towards an inclusive well-being economy has come with the widespread adoption of deliberative democracy approaches across the EU. Citizen councils and assemblies are widely established to develop and implement bespoke well-being policies in each local context. People trust each other and their governments.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario B – Sustainable High-tech Europe</strong></p>
<p>It is 2050, and the European Union does not exist anymore. The cause for the disintegration was the failure of “soft” democracy in the mitigation of all environmental challenges such as climate change, biodiversity erosion, the increase of pollution, and in autonomy in all vital goods and resources. Therefore, EU citizens became aware of the necessity for a rapid and radical change and turned their trust to strong national and local leaders, resulting in the high trust society coupled with autocratic regimes. End of EU meant the end of Common Policies such as Agriculture, Fisheries and Trade &amp; other EU programmes and funds, end of financial transfers for solidarity, cohesion, CAP etc. ap in economic growth across and within countries widened. Regimes of weak or pseudo democracies, specialised to compete in global markets, are heavily dependent on global trade of key commodities such as food, energy and raw materials such as minerals and metals. Other major geopolitical blocks have also vanished, and countries have looked for the UN system as well as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to provide common guidance, though major tensions remain on regulating global trade and the balance between developed and developing countries. In Europe, the management of rural, coastal and marine areas is aligned with national plans under the guidance of the UN bodies promoting sustainable use of resources, conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In Europe, countries have their national specialisation strategies, some with global leadership in regenerative and multi-functional high-tech solutions for energy, aquaculture and agriculture, but others struggle to well position themselves in the global markets.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario C – United States of Europe</strong></p>
<p>By 2050 the citizens and governments of Europe have collectively agreed that an ever-closer union keeps Europe competitive in a world dominated by geo-political power blocks. Centrally coordinated planned interventions based on geographical orographic systems rather than the tyranny of national boundaries help also manage the needs of European citizens and critical environmental infrastructure. A strong ‘United States of Europe’ can shape rural and marine environments to meet the needs of wider society. The marine and rural areas are, especially, places of primary production and consumption. Intensive vertical farming, for example, takes place within the urban environment where the facilities to manage pollution more effectively are more concentrated and consumption is near. The rural and marine environments are managed as a collective integrated space delivering not just food but many of the ecosystem services valued and required by urban society. Certain shocks to the system, war, and famine, have highlighted the need for greater cooperation and a more unified decision-making structure to meet the needs and aspirations of European citizens. The ability of Europe to recover from the shock has emphasised the need for more autocratic, rational and centralised decision making which has widespread support and trust from the citizens. Isolationist and independent nation-states were too small to compete on a global stage. Therefore, Europe as an entity has evolved to exercise a high degree of power and trust through top-down decision-making within Europe. Europe is an active and powerful global player in trade and sustainability agenda (ecoefficient land use, carbon offsetting and spaces for renewal energy and intensive areas for food production), thanks to the leadership of ‘Brussels’ through centralised decision-making widely accepted by society.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario D – European Permacrisis</strong></p>
<p>This scenario sketches Europe with a history of economic turmoil, with a population and political system fraught with distrust and a lack of firm decisions to solve the pattern of crises. People connect to and trust their peers and others in their ‘bubble’; others are distrusted. The economic degrowth leads to self-sufficiency efforts for energy, materials and food. To support local industries, tariffs are applied for most imports, especially carbon-intensive products.</p>
<p>The political arena is scattered and characterized by many small single-issue protest parties. National governments feel they have no mandate to take firm decisions. Laws are issued, but their quality and resources to implement them vary. Due to the weak position of politicians, companies influence political decisions. The weak economy leads to low rates of innovation, and the R&amp;I that takes place is applied and financed by the companies to ensure their market position. For agriculture, it has resulted in more precision agriculture and other ways to reduce losses of nutrients and water use. The lack of competition with food providers from other parts of the world allows to use more sustainable inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>None of the scenarios features a decisive solution to the global climate and biodiversity crises. Scenario A forcefully targets the resolution of the biodiversity crisis in Europe, by aligning human practices with nature, but provides little support to global climate and biodiversity crises. Scenario B proactively tackles the biodiversity crisis both in Europe and internationally but struggles with the fragmentation of efforts and with scaling up good practices and wider impact to curb the crisis. Scenarios C and D with intensive use of nature reduce biodiversity. Thanks to European-wide coordination Scenario C can protect vast areas with positive impacts to biodiversity, whereas Scenario D also struggles with the major fragmentation of conservation efforts and its detrimental impact on biodiversity. Such challenges illustrate the importance of balanced approaches in developing both local and global solutions to climate and biodiversity crises.</p>
<p>All scenarios depict a future of rural and marine areas in the context of extreme weather events and ecological crises, all be it with different intensities. Social developments, instead, range from major social confrontations to more collaborative and inclusive practices.</p>
<p><strong>Final remarks</strong></p>
<p>This brief is the result of one of eight Deep Dive Foresight Studies in the project <a href=""https://www.futures4europe.eu/project/european-ri-foresight-and-public-engagement-for-horizon-europe-bveiy"" target=""_blank"">‘European R&amp;I Foresight and Public Engagement for Horizon Europe’</a>  conducted by the Foresight on Demand consortium for the European Commission. During the spring of 2023, an expert team identified factors of change and organised two scenario and one policy implications workshops also engaging experts from academia, business and public administration around Europe. The process was also supported by discussions in the Horizon Europe Foresight Network.

","<p>The conference focussed on the role of Science and Technology Studies (STS) in contributing to transformations at the times of grand societal challenges. Titled “<a href=""https://www.easst4s2024.net/theme/"" target=""_self"">Making and Doing Transformations</a>”, the conference gathered some 3200 people. Among the 115 conference panels, several focussed on forward-looking activities and governance tools with some referring to foresight in one way or another. With science and technology governance at the heart of STS, the thematic areas of foresight-related presentations varied from oceanic and European space futures to food systems, housing conditions for minorities, synthetic biology, and AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel by the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) focussed on foresight for policymaking in the context of the grand societal challenges as part of the current EU policies and activities. Titled “<a href=""https://www.easst4s2024.net/programme/#14459"" target=""_self"">How foresight, imagination and innovation studies contribute to transformation – in search for theory and methods</a><strong>”, </strong>the panel hosted two sessions and aimed to bring insights on theoretical aspects of foresight, as well as possible practice examples. Approaches that embrace active participation of civil society, stimulate the mutual exchange of ideas and perspectives, and the agency of citizens in foresight studies were of special interest. Given the interest of foresight in multiple futures and multiple audiences and abstracts from other parts of the world, we highly encouraged and contributed to the commitment of EASST and 4S to becoming more geographically diverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first session, <em>“Governing energy futures through modern and contemporary scenario modalities”</em><strong>,</strong> Limor Samimian-Darash ((The Hebrew University of Jerusalem) analysed the design and use of global energy scenarios in the World Energy Council (WEC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) by addressing foresight modalities and their possible contribution to future transition and social change. In the other session, “<em>Envisioning the future of UN SDGs: insights from engineering students through Futures Wheel method”</em> Gül Beyza Kocamış (Middle East Technical University) presented experiences of using Futures Wheel method at a workshop with engineering students while being a master’s student herself. Through qualitative analysis and canvas study, they discussed the evolution of selected UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), revealing opportunities and threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other sessions with foresight-relevant theses were:</p>
<p><em>“</em><a href=""https://www.easst4s2024.net/programme/#14240"" target=""_self""><em>Exploring Anticipatory Governance</em></a><em>” </em>by Nils Matzner (Technical University Munich) and Ina Möller (Wageningen University and Research) aimed at discussing the multiple usages of Anticipatory Governance – as a normative concept, an analytical framework, and an actual practice. In one of the sessions –<em>“Future-oriented governance: investigating the interface between AI and synthetic biology” </em>by Huayu Xin (The University of Edinburgh, Zhejiang University), the author argues for transitioning from reactive to anticipatory governance in the context of challenges posed by the complexity and uncertainty of AI integration in synthetic biology. By employing fact-based technology foresight, the case study develops hypothetical governance models and accommodates emerging technologies trends and their implications for societal governance structures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the panel <em>“</em><a href=""https://www.easst4s2024.net/programme/#14091"" target=""_self""><em>What can we do for tomorrow? New sensitivities for long-term governance</em></a><em>” </em>by Sophie Kuppler, Laura Müller, Stefania Sardo (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)); Dirk Scheer (Institute for Technology Assessment and System Analysis (ITAS) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)), the authors discussed the role of scientists in ensuring a socially and environmentally just processes. One of the sessions in this panel focused on the framework concept of Long-term governance (LTG) and its promise to better understand and prepare political actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the panel on “<a href=""https://www.easst4s2024.net/programme/#13841"" target=""_self""><em>Outer space: imaginaries, infrastructures and interventions</em></a>” by Nina Klimburg-Witjes, Joseph Popper (University of Vienna), Matjaz Vidmar (University of Edinburgh) a session titled “<em>Exploring strategic visioning for European space futures in the 'making'</em>”, Nina Klimburg-Witjes and Philipp Kürten (University of Vienna) used interdisciplinary ethnography, combining STS, Social Studies of Outer Space and Critical Futures Studies to discuss how European space futures are envisioned through structured foresight and futuring processes, while also serving as a tool for European integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In “<a href=""https://www.easst4s2024.net/programme/#14461"" target=""_self""><em>Engaging experimental methods for transformative knowledge-making: new horizons in STS and ethnographic research</em></a>”, convenors Angela Marques Filipe (Durham University) and Órla Meadhbh Murray (Northumbria University Newcastle) and discussants Tiago Moreira (Durham University) and Ayo Wahlberg (University of Copenhagen) explore the use of experimental methods and/or multimodal ethnographies across topics in STS (including health, wellbeing and climate). These unconventional approaches aim to engage with lived experiences and living environments in charting new horizons and forms of knowledge-making. One of the sessions “<em>Housing exploratory scenarios for minorities in Brussels: an attempt of feminist foresight</em>” by Agie Galicy Totolehibe (UClouvain); Emma Peltier (Université Catholique de Louvain) presented an experimental method for anticipating the housing conditions of minorities (sex, gender, race, etc.) in the Brussels region. The feminist perspective was particularly interesting as it considers the issues of power and inequality, as feminist perspectives are in the minority in foresight methods (Milojević and Inayatullah, 1998.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In “<a href=""https://www.easst4s2024.net/programme/#14420"" target=""_self""><em>Living on Speculative Knowledge Systems (LoSKnoS)</em></a>” convenors Martin Perez Comisso (Universidad de Chile), Juan Felipe Espinosa Cristia (Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María) explored speculation as a knowledge system and a rational act of envisioning theories, realities, and even worlds without ""enough evidence."" In one of the sessions, “<em>Toward a Media Archaeology of Speculation: Algorithms, Data, and Divination”</em>, the author Leona Nikolić (Concordia University) uses a media archaeological approach (Parikka, 2012) to conceptually situate AI amongst techniques of speculation to to determine how technologies of speculation have and continue to shape one another across shifting societal contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In “<a href=""https://www.easst4s2024.net/programme/#14200"" target=""_self""><em>Making and doing oceanic futures: mobilising the ocean and its materialities between hope and loss</em></a>”, Francesco Colona (Leiden University), Judit Varga (Leiden University) and Sarah Rose Bieszczad (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University)  discussed how oceanic futures are entangled with hope and loss and how these futures intersect with socio-political, scientific, economic, industrial and ecological processes. In a session titled “<em>Oceanic futures: confluence or divergence?</em>” Max Priebe (Fraunhofer ISI and Radboud University ISIS); Sabine Reitmaier (Freie Universität Berlin); Aaron Rosa (Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research (ISI)); Riyan van den Born (Radboud University); Bernadette van Heel (Radboud University) and Philine Warnke (Fraunhofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research ISI) discussed divergent visions of oceanic futures by scrutinizing various anticipatory practices and horizon scanning research.</p>

","<p>The 14th of June marked the second Deep Dives Dissemination Workshop, focusing on the future of land and sea use. The workshop started with the presentation of The Deep Dive report on Rural and Marine areas in Europe. The report approached the topic from the perspective of using land and sea for restoring biodiversity, involving issues of governance and ownership of land, as well as access and use rights. Four dimensions were used as the basis for scenarios: the economic model, focusing on growth and global trade versus a self-sufficient Europe; environment and production, showing, on one extreme, Europe undertaking intensive mass production of food and a regenerative multifunctional production on the other; low versus high trust in society; and an autocratic versus a deliberative governance model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amongst the 16 different possible futures along these dimensions, four alternative scenarios were developed:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>European civic eco-village</strong>: Based on a post-growth and autonomous Europe, much of the food chains are local and short, featuring many cooperative practices. There is a strong focus on nature rights and care for the environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable high-tech Europe in the World Trade</strong>: With a strong focus on regenerative production, honing a high trust society but a weak democracy, the EU no longer exists and is replaced by strong local leaders that re-establish the trust of the people in the local level. On a greater scale, the UN regulates global trade instead of the EU. The management of rural, coastal and marine areas is aligned with national plans and Europe is well aligned with the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>United States of Europe</strong>: This growth scenario for global trade centers around mass and intensive food production processes with weak democracy and high trust. Furthermore, there is a need for unified autocratic decision-making. Europe is a powerful global player in terms of global trade and its sustainability agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>European permacrisis</strong>: This scenario paints a picture of a post-growth, autonomous Europe, reminiscent of the first scenario but with a twist: it's marked by intensive mass food production. The political landscape is fragmented, dominated by niche single-issue protest parties. Innovation stagnates, and the legal framework suffers from low quality and poor execution. Corporate giants hold significant sway over decisions. Coordination in land use is scant, making nature conservation zones a rare sight. This environment breeds intense competition, making scalability a challenging endeavor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The scenarios’ implications for policy</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the policy dimension, the scenarios have interconnected effects on various areas like energy, transportation, farming, and fishing. The scenarios highlight a strong focus on making gradual improvements that support a diverse approach to utilising both land and sea resources. These gradual improvements to both land and sea resources usage were further discusssed in the subsequent presentations of the <a href=""https://www.organicseurope.bio/"" target=""_self"">IFOAM</a> and <a href=""https://www.h2020-flow.eu/"" target=""_self"">FLOW</a> initiatives, which both aim to enhance production systems and the integrity of supply chain or one’s relationship to ocean and water and coastal resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we shift our gaze to demographics, lifestyles, and values, the narrative centers around bolstering civic resilience and readiness. This is particularly poignant for rural regions, which need to diversify and foster shared practices that bridge the urban-rural divide. On the governance front, the discourse underscores the pivotal role of citizen engagement in decision-making processes. It also spotlights the intertwined nature of societal and economic resilience, drawing attention to the harmonious relationship between nature restoration and economic activities. The <a href=""https://www.moving-h2020.eu/"" target=""_self"">MOVING</a> project resonated vividly with these principles, as it seeks to strengthen value chains that enhance the resilience and sustainability of mountain regions in the face of climate change and other drivers. It was also exhibited in a later part of the workshop as a real case example of how innovative approaches can be practically applied to address pressing environmental challenges, demonstrating the tangible impact of aligning principles with action in safeguarding vulnerable ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another related point was raised about the importance of the interaction between land and sea, as marine special planning is a comprehensive approach to managing human activities in marine and coastal areas. It is about balancing competing demands while preserving the ecological integrity of marine ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As discussions unfolded, apprehensions arose regarding the ""United States of Europe"" scenario, particularly its emphasis on autocratic decision-making. Many participants felt that, given Europe's historical and cultural backdrop, autocracy seemed improbable. Instead, they pinpointed misinformation and the misuse of social media as the most pressing threats to modern democracy. In their perspective, a more plausible scenario would be a fragile democracy, undermined by the pervasive spread of misinformation. However, the deep dive team clarified that their intention wasn't to rank scenarios based on likelihood but to explore a spectrum of possibilities, including the extremes. They posited that the scenario in question juxtaposed autocracy with high public trust, suggesting that even in a crisis, a well-functioning democracy could resort to top-down decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other comments surrounded implications for research and development as well as sustainable management of land and water. An imperative is to look for solutions limiting potential conflicts in competitive use of land and sea, especially between food and nonfood uses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The considerations posed by the audience on this topic generated a wide array of thought-provoking discussions and paved the way for a deeper exploration into the intricacies of the subject. These dialogues not only highlighted the complexities and nuances inherent to the future of land and sea use but also underscored the importance of diverse perspectives in shaping a comprehensive understanding.&nbsp;</p>

","<p>Innovation is changing in several dimensions. First, the initially closed innovation processes are complemented by various forms of open innovation. Second, consequently, innovation is not only performed by companies, but other actors, like users or non-governmental organisations get involved. Third, the dominance of product innovation based on hardware components is not only complemented but also partly substituted by digital components including software. Finally, the initially envisaged impact of innovation on firms and countries; economic success has been significantly widened in its contribution to sustainable development. Consequently, the existing IP regime is challenged by both its processes and its products, the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).</p>
<p>We explore how these changes in several dimensions of innovation might influence the IP regimes, its processes, and products, including their implementation and impacts in the future.</p>

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of past, current, and upcoming efforts to shape the future of Intellectual Property Rights</p>","<p>In the lead-up to the 2019 meetings of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Assemblies, WIPO Director General Francis Gurry reflected in an<a href=""https://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/news/2019/news_0002.html"" target=""undefined""> article</a> on the implications of big data for intellectual property rights (IPR) policy. His views highlight the convergence of big data and IPR, pointing to the need to reflect on the adaptations required in IPR within a landscape shaped by extensive data sources, questioning the effectiveness of the traditional IP system in addressing the numerous issues arising from prevalent data-driven technologies in the digital economy.  Many discussions revolve around the limitations of data usage within AI-based algorithms, such as whether training AI for deep-learning purposes violates copyright law. Today, in a world of rapid technological advancements, these considerations become even more significant, calling for initiatives that effectively address the future of IPR. The following provides a comprehensive look at past, current, and upcoming efforts addressing the future of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).</p>
<p>In 2007, the European Patent Office (EPO) developed<a href=""https://link.epo.org/web/EPO_scenarios_bookmarked.pdf"" target=""undefined""> ""Scenarios for the Future""</a> investigating the following two inquiries: How could IP regimes transform by 2025? To what extent might these regimes gain global credibility? The aim was to ensure that the system continues to effectively support innovation, competitiveness, and economic growth for the benefit of European citizens. These future scenarios for intellectual property envisioned diverse landscapes:</p>
<p>· Market Rules, where business dominance prevails, empowering multinational corporations to wield substantial influence, shape patent landscapes, and navigate an increasingly litigious environment</p>
<p>· Whose Game? a realm influenced by geopolitics, witnessing shifts in power dynamics among established and emerging players, while many developing nations operate within a communal knowledge paradigm, intensifying global competition.</p>
<p>· Trees of Knowledge reflects a world shaped by societal influences where diminishing trust and mounting criticism gradually erode the IP system, prompting collaborative challenges to established norms by civil society movements and concerned stakeholders.</p>
<p>· Blue Skies envisions a future where technology takes precedence, leading to a split in the patent system due to systemic risks, with technocrats and policymakers emphasising the role of complex, innovative technologies in addressing global crises like climate change and the importance of technology diffusion.</p>
<p>More recent initiatives, such as <a href=""https://www.ige.ch/en/intellectual-property/ip-and-society/future-scenarios"" target=""undefined"">the Swiss Federal Institute of IP's exploration of future scenarios</a>, sheds light on current developments pertinent to intellectual property. Emerging trends and technologies continually pose challenges regarding IP. Today, areas like the internet of things (IoT) and blockchain command the attention of IP experts. Other areas such as Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, Internet of Things, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Blockchain are also subjects highly relevant to IP discussions. These areas are integral to various reports, notably stemming from events like the Artificial Intelligence &amp; Intellectual Property Workshop (AI&amp;IP Workshop) and the <a href=""https://www.sic-online.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Sic-Online/2022/documents/541.pdf"" target=""undefined"">report</a> emerging from the AI&amp;IP conference held in Zurich from June 9th to 11th, 2022. This report showcases insights into how the intellectual property (PI) system could evolve and respond to the challenges presented by AI and delves into various aspects such as the role of IP in the context of AI for businesses, Patent law, and Copyright law.</p>
<p>More recently, the WIPO is currently developing an area dedicated to the <a href=""https://www.wipo.int/about-wipo/en/activities_by_unit/index.jsp?id=1045&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAr8eqBhD3ARIsAIe-buMo0VR6QlmbRo_2Ujh_DFNnPRR7A0H4lRmGnJ_ki_21QEsNTx4sgxAaAhBxEALw_wcB"" target=""undefined"">Future of Intellectual Property</a> within the Global Challenges and Partnerships Sector. The tasks will include conducting forward-looking and anticipatory studies, brainstorming and ideating, as well as orchestrating in-house interdisciplinary dialogues on cutting-edge matters concerning the future development of Intellectual Property. Its aim will be to offer guidance, leadership, and policy alternatives on emerging global challenges, significant societal concerns, and cutting-edge IP developments. Further details about this department's launch are anticipated in 2024.</p>

Yet, the governance conversation remains fragmented—split between technical alignment research and moral philosophy—while the security and diplomatic dimensions of AI risk remain underdeveloped. On one side, we have the technical alignment community focusing on how to make advanced AI systems behave safely—through methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback, interpretability, scalable oversight, or robustness testing. On the other side, ethics communities focus on what values or principles AI should embody—such as justice, fairness, human rights, autonomy, the “good society.” If nuclear weapons introduced deterrence as the logic of the twentieth century, advanced AI may introduce coordination under opacity as the logic of the twenty-first.<br><br>When we speak of “AI safety,” we often refer to technical robustness or alignment with human values. But the survival problem before us is much broader: how to maintain international stability and institutional coherence in a world where cognitive capability itself becomes a variable of power. This requires not only engineering but diplomacy, foresight, and the deliberate design of what we might call societal defences—systems of trust, transparency, and adaptive governance resilient enough to withstand the pressures of transformative intelligence.<br><br>The ideas here are informed by systems-thinking practice, research on AI corporate accountability with The Midas Project, and engagement across foresight and diplomacy communities. My claim is simple: to make AI “go well,” humanity must treat it as a strategic governance challenge, demanding the same disciplined cooperation that once stabilised nuclear deterrence.</p>
","<p><strong>Diplomacy and the Logic of Containment</strong><br><br>Diplomacy, at its essence, is the management of uncertainty through communication. Historically it has served to prevent misunderstandings from cascading into existential catastrophe—from the Concert of Europe to the Cuban Missile Crisis. The same strategic logic must now be applied to AI.<br><br>Unlike nuclear arms, AI systems proliferate through weights, data, and code rather than fissile material. Containment, therefore, cannot rely on physical inspection alone; it must rely on confidence-building measures, such as information-sharing, model reporting standards, joint evaluation protocols, and reciprocal transparency commitments. These are diplomatic instruments, not merely regulatory ones.<br><br>Corporate actors—OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and their emerging peers—have become de facto sovereigns in capability development. Engaging them requires Track II diplomacy: structured dialogues between non-state actors that complement formal treaties. AI corporate accountability, which my Veritas research will explore, functions as precisely such a bridge—aligning private incentives with public security through disclosure, auditability, and shared oversight mechanisms.<br><br>The aim is not to slow innovation arbitrarily, but to stabilise expectations: to create predictable norms of behaviour under conditions of accelerating capability. Diplomacy remains the only mechanism humanity has ever invented for that purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Peace and Security in the Algorithmic Century</strong><br><br>Advanced AI introduces novel risks to global peace and stability. In terms of strategic instability, autonomous decision-making systems in defence or cyber domains could shorten reaction times beyond human capacity, heightening escalation risk. Second, in informational warfare: synthetic media and generative propaganda already erode epistemic trust, undermining the deliberative foundations of democracy. And third, in economic asymmetry: control over frontier models and compute resources could produce a concentration of power rivaling the industrial monopolies of previous centuries.<br><br>Macroeconomic transitions are likely to follow the contours of automation bifurcation: productivity gains accruing to capital while displacing cognitive labour. States unable to integrate displaced workforces may experience fiscal contraction and social unrest. The emergence of “AI OPECs”—cartels controlling compute or training data—could reshape trade relations and trigger new forms of resource nationalism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politically, most parties are only beginning to future-proof themselves against these shifts. Some European Greens and Liberals have incorporated AI ethics into digital charters, although newer transnational movements such as <a href=""https://volteuropa.org"" target=""_blank"">Volt Europa</a>––where I contribute to Chapter strategy––have started to treat longterm existential risk as a governance challenge, rather than a niche concern. Yet mainstream parties still rarely treat existential security as a core policy category. This vacuum leaves space for techno-populism and for geopolitical blocs to form around competing AI ideologies: democratic-pluralist, authoritarian-centralised, or corporate-technocratic. In this volatile landscape, diplomacy becomes crisis prevention: establishing channels between these paradigms before misperception evolves into confrontation.</p>
<p><strong>Governance Fragility and the Institutional Lag</strong><br><br>Existing institutions were designed for threats that are linear, territorial, and observable. AI development, by contrast, is exponential, transnational, and partially opaque. This mismatch produces what we might call institutional lag—the delay between technological transformation and the adaptive response of governance systems.<br><br>Europe illustrates both the promise and peril of complex governance. The EU, OSCE, and Council of Europe create multiple nodes of accountability, yet coordination remains slow. The EU AI Act (2024) establishes vital regulatory baselines, but without dynamic feedback loops it risks ossification. Regulation must learn at the pace of innovation; otherwise, even compliance becomes performative.<br><br>Corporate opacity compounds this fragility. Without standardised disclosure on model capabilities, training data, and risk evaluation, policymakers are negotiating in informational darkness. Here again, diplomacy offers a template: verification regimes akin to those in arms control. Instead of centrifuge counts, we would verify compute flows; and instead of enrichment thresholds, capability thresholds. Such analogies may appear extreme, but they reflect a shared logic—containment through cooperative transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Thinking and Foresight as Preventive Diplomacy</strong><br><br>From a systems-thinking perspective, governance failures are not isolated errors but feedback breakdowns. A small misalignment at the policy level can cascade into global fragility if signals are delayed or ignored. Resilient systems are characterised by redundancy, diversity, and learning capacity.<br><br>Applying this to AI governance, foresight functions as preventive diplomacy: scenario planning, red-teaming, and cross-sector simulations allow states and firms to anticipate failure modes before they materialise. The EU’s Joint Research Centre and initiatives like Futures4Europe already experiment with foresight methodologies, but integrating expertise from these communities into AI policy processes could provide early warning of strategic misalignment or technological shock.<br><br>I also argue that a second layer of foresight must be participatory: technocratic governance alone risks legitimacy collapse. Deliberative assemblies—citizen panels, cross-party foresight councils, and equivalents of global town halls—can anchor governance in democratic consent. My experience reviewing for the Journal of Deliberative Democracy has shown that inclusion improves both legitimacy and epistemic quality: in other words, diverse publics can spot blind spots that experts overlook. Participation is not antithetical to security; it is part of it. When societies perceive AI governance as opaque or elite-driven, compliance erodes and extremism fills the void.</p>
","<p><strong>Europe’s Strategic Readiness</strong><br><br>Europe is often praised for normative leadership—GDPR, digital-rights frameworks, and now the AI Act. Yet normative leadership without strategic readiness is somewhat fragile. Operationally, Europe depends heavily on foreign compute infrastructure and private frontier models; strategically, it lacks a unified foresight capability comparable to the U.S. National Intelligence Council or China’s State AI Planning Office. Whilst Europe possesses a diverse foresight ecosystem—JRC, ESPAS, EEAS, and several national foresight bodies—it lacks a centralised, directive foresight authority capable of integrating technological and security planning at the continental scale. Is this weakness, or strength? Time will tell.<br><br>Nevertheless, Europe’s polycentric diplomacy—its capacity to negotiate overlapping jurisdictions—can become an asset. We can envision a European AI Safety Accord built on three pillars:<br><br>– Interoperable standards for risk classification and model auditing.<br>– Transparent compute registries to monitor large-scale training runs.<br>– Multilateral crisis hotlines between states and frontier labs for incident reporting.<br><br>Such frameworks could mirror the 1975 Helsinki Accords––a landmark Cold War–era agreement that stabilised postwar borders––which used soft law and confidence-building to reduce systemic tension. The objective is not control, but stability through communication—a principle at the heart of both diplomacy and AI safety. To operationalise this, Europe must integrate foresight units across key ministries––Foreign Affairs, Defence, Economy, Justice, and more—to ensure that anticipatory governance is integrated into security planning, industrial policy, and human-capital development alike. Europe might also support cross-sector fellowships, and cultivate “diplomatic technologists” fluent in both governance and AI risk science. For now, we are already seeing success with Finland’s <em>Parliamentary Committee for the Future</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Future of International Justice</strong><br><br>AI will soon transform the international justice system—from evidence gathering to sentencing analytics. Machine-learning tools already assist in identifying war-crimes imagery [<a href=""https://www.gen-ai.witness.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Deepfakes-in-the-Dock_Preparing-Intl-Justice-for-Generative-AI.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Deepfakes in the Dock (2024)</a>, WITNESS] and analysing atrocity data. Through networks such as the <a href=""https://peacehumanity.org"" target=""_blank"">Platform for Peace &amp; Humanity</a>, where I contribute as a news writer on international justice, we see practitioners grappling with the evidentiary and ethical implications of digital transformation in conflict monitoring. These communities are beginning to articulate normative guardrails for the responsible use of AI in accountability processes—a microcosm of the broader governance challenge AI now poses to law and diplomacy alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet automation raises profound questions of legitimacy and accountability. If AI models contribute to human-rights violations—through surveillance, misinformation, or autonomous targeting—how will international law attribute responsibility? Existing doctrines of command responsibility presume human intent. We may require a new category: algorithmic liability.<br><br>Conversely, AI could strengthen justice by improving transparency and access, such as by providing searchable jurisprudence, multilingual translation, and predictive caseload management. But without safeguards, such systems risk encoding bias or geopolitical manipulation. The deeper concern lies in epistemic capture: if courts begin to rely on opaque algorithms for evidentiary or predictive reasoning, the authority of human judgement is eroded. International law must therefore establish auditable AI systems and digital chain-of-custody standards.<br><br>In short, I do not believe that AI will replace international justice, but it will certainly test its epistemic foundations. Diplomatic coordination—among states, firms, and civil society—will be required to ensure that automation strengthens, rather than supplants, the rule of law.</p>
<p><strong>Macroeconomic and Political Transitions Ahead</strong><br><br>The diffusion of generative and decision-making AI will alter global macroeconomics as profoundly as did industrialisation. According to <a href=""https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2024/03/using-ai-in-the-workplace_02d6890a/73d417f9-en.pdf"" target=""_blank"">OECD projections (2024)</a>, automation could affect up to 27 per cent of European employment within a decade. Fiscal systems reliant on income taxation will strain, and capital-intensive economies may experience widening inequality.<br><br>Geopolitically, control over compute and rare-earth supply chains could redefine alliances. The “chip diplomacy” already visible between the U.S., Taiwan, and the Netherlands illustrates a shift from energy to compute as the currency of power. Europe must therefore approach AI not merely as a regulatory issue, but as a strategic industrial policy issue.<br><br>Politically, we can expect these trends:<br><br>– Technocratic centralisation, as governments seek control over complex systems.<br>– Populist backlash, exploiting fears of automation and surveillance.<br>– Transnational civic networks forming to advocate for ethical governance.<br><br>Parties that ignore these shifts risk obsolescence. Future-proofing requires foresight integration into policymaking—treating long-term risk as a governance discipline, not a campaign theme.<br><br>The shared insight from AI safety, public security, foresight, and diplomacy is that defending civilisation from AI risk requires not only smarter machines, but smarter coordination. In diplomatic terms, this means replacing the zero-sum logic of past arms races with collective resilience agreements—frameworks where transparency and accountability are treated as global public goods. And here, Europe can lead by example, leveraging its multilateral tradition to prototype cooperative security mechanisms before irreversible capability asymmetries emerge.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Foresight as a Diplomatic Imperative</strong><br><br>AI governance is not a technical sidebar to international politics; it is international politics, and it will determine whether the next century is defined by cooperation, or collapse. I believe that effective diplomacy offers the grammar through which humanity can manage this transformation: dialogue under uncertainty, transparency without naivety, and deterrence without hostility. But diplomacy must now operate between humans and systems, governments and corporations, experts and citizens as well.<br><br>We are entering an era when peace will depend on our ability to coordinate with entities faster and possibly more complex than ourselves. Building societal defences—multi-layered, adaptive, and participatory—is thus not optional, but existential.</p>

How Europe is positioned against other global players in the race on hydrogen?</p>
<p>In 2019, around 120 million tonnes of hydrogen were produced globally, two-thirds of which is pure hydrogen and one-third of which is a mixture with other gases. China is the world’s largest producer and consumer of hydrogen, followed by the US and India (Figure 1).&nbsp;</p>
","<p>Production costs vary from less than €2 to €14/kg for green hydrogen. The low end of these ranges can be achieved most easily in locations with access to low-cost renewable energy plants. Importantly, hydrogen production costs are estimated to decrease by around 50% through 2030, and then continue to fall steadily at a slightly slower rate until 2050. By 2050, green hydrogen production costs in some parts of the Middle East, Africa, Russia, China, the US and Australia will be in the range of €1 to €1.5/kg. (<a href=""https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/energy-utilities-resources/future-energy/green-hydrogen-cost.html"" target=""_blank"">PWC</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Motivated by such projections, a growing number of countries and companies are engaged in intense competition for leadership in clean hydrogen technologies. </strong>In 2017, just one country (Japan) had a national hydrogen strategy. Today, around 45 countries are devising or have published hydrogen strategies, and several agreements have been concluded between countries to set up tomorrow’s trade routes for hydrogen (Figure 2). Furthermore, countries without specific hydrogen strategies are including hydrogen as part of their decarbonisation policies.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, we are still far from a world where green hydrogen plays a key role as a source of energy, given that demand for green hydrogen is limited and the infrastructure for green hydrogen is confined to industrial areas. Moreover, global electrolyser capacity amounts to just a few hundred megawatts, which lies significantly below the target of 115 GW by 2030 to meet the GH2 demands for all the published and announced strategies, and again far below the forecasted target of 5 TW by 2050, according to <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/green-hydrogen-climate-change-energy/"" target=""_blank"">IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook</a>.</p>
<p></p>
","<p><strong>China</strong></p>
<p>In March 2022, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in China released a hydrogen energy industry planning document for the period 2021-2035 (<a href=""https://research.csiro.au/hyresource/policy/international/"" target=""_blank"">source</a>); instead of a focus on subsidising the purchase of fuel cell vehicles (FCV), the policy will focus on developing China’s FCV sector in four key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieving breakthroughs in core technologies and key components along the FCV value chain</li>
<li>Carrying out demonstration projects promoting the use of fuel cells in medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles</li>
<li>Reducing costs and creating economies of scale across the FCV value chain from hydrogen production through to distribution</li>
<li>Improving the policy and institutional environment to support the adoption of fuel cell vehicles across the whole value chain from capability in core technologies through to construction and operation of refuelling stations.</li>
</ul>
<p>China consumes and produces more hydrogen than any other country – its current annual usage is more than 24 million tonnes. Most of the country’s production is “grey” hydrogen using fossil fuels, but more than 30 projects involving “green” hydrogen – created using emissions-free renewable energy – have been set up since 2019. China issued its first hydrogen roadmap in 2016, leading to it having the world’s third-largest fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) fleet and to the country becoming a pioneer in developing fuel cell trucks and buses. China’s five-year economic plan recognizes hydrogen as one of the six industries of the future. Hydrogen features also in 16 provincial and city energy strategies. (<a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/green-hydrogen-climate-change-energy/"" target=""_blank"">WEF</a>)</p>
<p><strong>United States</strong></p>
<p>The United States Department of Energy (US DOE) released its (research-focused) Hydrogen Program Plan in late 2020 and has been tasked to prepare a national strategy and roadmap to facilitate a clean hydrogen economy.[ix] The plan describes the overarching, cross-office framework for its hydrogen research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) activities and provides an overview of core technology areas, challenges, and R&amp;D priorities that the US DOE is pursuing in hydrogen technologies development.<br>When the government passed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, it contained a $9.5 billion budget to boost clean hydrogen development. This was followed by the launch of the government’s Hydrogen Earthshot programme, with its so-called “111 goals” to cut the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per 1 kilogramme in 1 decade. Furthermore, the DOE's USD8 billion programme to develop regional clean hydrogen hubs - H2Hubs will create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier over five years.</p>
<p>The US is the world’s second-biggest producer and consumer of hydrogen after China, accounting for 13% of global demand. US annual hydrogen production is currently about 10 million metric tonnes.[x] States such as California supported the country’s FCEV market growth for more than a decade with initiatives like the Clean Vehicle Rebate Programme. California published 2018 their vision of the Californian fuel cell revolution with an emphasis on mobility applications with key milestones including in 2025 – 200 refuelling stations, and 2030 – 1,000 stations, and 1,000,000 vehicles. (<a href=""https://research.csiro.au/hyresource/policy/international/united-states-california/"" target=""_blank"">source</a> )&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>India</strong></p>
<p>In February 2022, the Ministry of Power released a Notice regarding Green Hydrogen Policy. The Notice contains 13 points aimed at supporting India to meet its climate goals and making India a green hydrogen hub; such points include the waiver of inter-state transmission charges for a period of 25 years to the producer of green hydrogen and green ammonia from projects commissioned before 30 June 2025. The Notice also proposes the establishment of manufacturing zones for green hydrogen/green ammonia production plants. Media reports also noted that in a statement at the time of release of the Notice, the Ministry of Power noted that the initiatives included in the Notice would help in meeting the target of 5 million tonnes of <a href=""https://research.csiro.au/hyresource/policy/international/india/"" target=""_blank"">green hydrogen production by 2030</a>.</p>
<p>Policymakers are considering legislation requiring oil refineries and fertilizer plants to use a minimum quota of green hydrogen in their industrial processes. Green hydrogen could be a huge value-adding opportunity for India as it pivots towards renewables and away from imported fossil fuels. (<a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/green-hydrogen-climate-change-energy/"" target=""_blank"">WEF</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Japan</strong></p>
<p>In 2017, Japan became the first country to formulate a national hydrogen strategy as part of its ambition to become the world’s first “hydrogen society” by adopting the fuel across all sectors. In December 2020, METI released Japan’s ‘Green Growth Strategy Through Achieving Carbon Neutrality by 2050’, which includes five cross-sectional policy tools (or support measures) and action plans for 14 sectors. Decarbonisation of both the electricity and non-electricity sectors includes the widespread use of hydrogen (and derivative) energy. (<a href=""https://research.csiro.au/hyresource/policy/international/japan/"" target=""_blank"">source</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The country lacks the natural resources needed to deploy sufficient levels of wind or solar to generate clean hydrogen at scale, so it is developing long-term supply agreements to import hydrogen from overseas. Alongside government investment in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies – totalling $670 million in 2020 – policymakers have set mobility targets of 800,000 FCEVs and 900 hydrogen refuelling stations by 2030. (<a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/green-hydrogen-climate-change-energy/"" target=""_blank"">WEF</a>)</p>
<p><strong>South Korea</strong></p>
<p>South Korea’s 2019 hydrogen roadmap hailed clean hydrogen as a key driver of economic growth and job creation. The nation has its sights set on becoming a global leader in producing and deploying FCEVs and large-scale stationary fuel cells for hydrogen power generation. Its Green New Deal contains an ambitious target of deploying 200,000 FCEVs by 2025 – about 20 times more than in 2020. And last year, South Korea passed the Economic Promotion and Safety Control of Hydrogen Act, the world’s first law aimed at promoting hydrogen vehicles, charging stations and fuel cells. Plans are in place for hydrogen to provide 10% of the energy needs of its cities, counties and towns by 2030, with its share rising to 30% by 2040 before it becomes the country’s largest single energy carrier by mid-century. (<a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/green-hydrogen-climate-change-energy/"" target=""_blank"">W</a>EF)</p>
<p><strong>Other countries</strong></p>
<p>Net energy importers like Chile, in South America, and African countries such as Morocco and Namibia are emerging as exporters of emissions-free green hydrogen. Meanwhile, fossil fuel exporters like Australia, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are looking to clean hydrogen to help diversify their economies.

","<p><em>The policy implications below are part of the deep dive ""Social Confrontations"" under the ""European R&amp;I foresight and public engagement for Horizon Europe"" project.</em> <br><br>The scenarios deal with various bifurcations social confrontations might take in the future and their impact on European democracy. Some extreme pathways for R&amp;I policymaking in the context of these scenarios have been sketched as well such as prioritization of certain technologies. The following section summarizes crucial implications derived from the scenarios for R&amp;I policy in different categories which are elaborated below. They are not meant to be recommendations but rather inspirations for further debate. In this section, four main questions concerning R&amp;I policy implications in the context of social confrontations can be differentiated: <br><br>The first part raises the question of how R&amp;I policy on the macro-level can have an impact toward more equity and equality. The second part is dedicated to the notion of more democratisation and participation in the process of R&amp;I priority setting. How R&amp;I policy could be geared towards the stimulation of more socio-ecological transformation is the focus of the third part. The fourth and final part explores future European R&amp;I focus areas of relevance to the four scenarios.<br><br><strong>Can R&amp;I policy set steps toward more equity and equality?</strong> <br><br>The context of social confrontation and the four scenarios give us the unique chance to look at R&amp;I policy from a social equity and equality perspective. R&amp;I policy at the MS level is more likely to play a role here from a governance perspective than the EC, but the EC could implement good practice examples, e.g., by taking the following measures:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Social criteria for public R&amp;I funds benefitting civil society<br>When distributing R&amp;I funds to projects, criteria can be defined on the common good quality of the project objectives and the recipients, for example: Human dignity, solidarity and justice, environmental sustainability, transparency, and co-decision-making&nbsp;</li>
<li>Social innovations coupled with technological innovation<br>Stimulating and funding social innovation is a possibility to integrate marginalized groups and give them a chance for their own agency and the opportunity of participation in social and economic activities. Social innovations can thus serve as means to reduce the potential for harmful social confrontations. Thus, each research project geared toward (technological) innovation should be assessed for its potential to generate social innovations for the benefit of marginalized groups – and be prioritized for public funding if this benefit out pays the negative effects (from the perspective of society, not the individual).<br><br><strong>Options for more stakeholder and public participation in R&amp;I policy?</strong>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Democratising decisions on investment (e.g. in industrial R&amp;I, public R&amp;I)<br><br>New approaches to democratise the decision-making processes on how investments in R&amp;I are taken and for what purpose can include<br>- Grant more decision-making power to the employees, for example, without infringing the secrecy of strategic directions;<br>- Co-decision making on R&amp;I investments could also be one criterion for the allocation of public R&amp;I funds to projects<br>because people learn how to participate and common decision-making process make the outcomes more robust and less susceptible to social confrontations:&nbsp;</li>
<li>Neo-tripartite decision-making processes at the member state level:<br><br>The co-decision-making process on setting research priorities can be organized in a neo-tripartite manner: between government representatives, industry, and social partners. Based on the old corporatist model, it is crucial, however, to include more than the traditional representatives. Instead, other groups of society need to be incorporated as well in a fair and representative manner, e.g., the younger generation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Institutional reform for learning and teaching co-decision making<br><br>Co-decision-making process can help manage social confrontations productively. One way to better deal with social confrontation and use them as a resource for a more stable and resilient democracy is to learn and practice co-decision-making process from early on and in as many occasions as possible. Better than accepting social confrontations is even to teach people from early on how to engage in co-decision making. Thus, corporate companies and research organisations as well as R&amp;I institutions including policymaking need to define strategies how a higher level of co-decision-making can be achieved, e.g., by consent-orientation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Experiments for new forms of governance<br><br>Beyond R&amp;I policy making, new approaches for institutional reform in the field of policy and administration are necessary. More dialogue needs to be initiated to inspire creative solutions and mutual learning activities, across Europe and beyond. This should also entail visions of a more inclusive governance structure that grants rights to people with diverse criteria, not only nationality. <br><br><strong>What alternative approaches of R&amp;I towards socio-ecological transformation need to be designed?</strong> <br><br>The climate crisis will be a major cause of adversity and desperation in our society in the future. It will bring about more inequity, more inequality and more social confrontation. Accordingly, containing and mitigating the effects of the climate crisis needs to be the focus of socially responsible R&amp;I policy:&nbsp;</li>
<li>Role of R&amp;I in ecological transformation/degrowth<br><br>The potential climate effects of R&amp;I investments need to be assessed before these investments are made. A fundamental assumption needs to be cleared: is more growth contributing to the climate crisis or what are alternatives that move towards degrowth?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Dealing with the (uneven) consequences of climate change<br><br>Even if it sounds challenging, new concepts need to be developed to share and distribute the severe consequences of climate change evenly, especially regarding the burden the global south has to carry. These new concepts need to be co-developed. Especially when decisions for investments in new technologies are taken, an a-priori assessment of the short-, mid-, and long-term effect on the climate should be mandatory. Such an assessment should also take the voice of those people into account that will be negatively affected by the consequences of such a technology along its lifecycle. One option is to install an advisory board of representative members of society to be involved in the up-front assessment, the decision on the funding, and possible mitigation strategies for the consequences. <br><br><strong>What are Future European R&amp;I focus areas of relevance to the four scenarios?</strong>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Alternative forms of housing and living<br><br>For many, housing is a human right. However, the reality in Europe is much different, not the least due to a severe market failure. All governments and societies in the EU struggle with the task to provide sufficient quantity and quality of affordable housing. More research and innovation need to be done to develop alternative ways not only of housing construction (material, design, recycling, reuse etc.) but also of financing housing, and alternative ways of living (and working); further to adapt buildings to the changing requirement of people at an affordable price. Additionally, new hardware needs to be developed and more efficientproduction processes, meeting ecological requirements without harming the environment any further.&nbsp;</li>
<li>New technologies and social approaches to detect troll armies and fake news<br><br>- Democratic procedures are required to avoid a ’dictatorship of machines’ as well as to avoid a dictatorship of autocrats that make use of machines. While there are already some technologies in place to detect troll armies and fake news that can harm democratic and economic processes, it is necessary to make these simpler and applicable for the average users. AI and IT experts are very knowledgeable in identifying fake news and they programme complex tools for this purpose. What is needed, however, are automatic tools that alert lay people when fake news and troll army operations appear on their IT gadgets, and education to use and interpret them. At best, detecting tools are always a step ahead or at least at the same level of development with malware producers.<br><br>- Though the recent Digital Services Act (DSA) aims to tackle social media problems as wide-ranging as content regulation and the protection of users, such as misogyny, disinformation and consumer fraud, some concerns remain. One deficit is that for users it is not always transparent that their data are transferred to outside the EU and how they are processed.<br><br>- Actions to prevent online hate speech are not sufficiently regulated. And aside from the DSA, is the issue of educated usage of social media and the user’s capability to identify fake and harmful content on the spot. Further regulations have to be developed – at best in a participatory way – in order to contain the unprecedented growth of big tech firms and their increase of power on almost all spheres of people’s life.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Socially responsible AI<br><br>Average AI tool, e.g., algorithms, reflect mainstream users and discriminate against minorities. Conventional attributes used in the context of AI programming perpetuate cultural biases from the real world to the virtual world and back. To break through this wall of biases new approaches have to be developed that take the patterns of other ethnicities, cultures, genders, ages etc. into account and create a more diverse and democratic virtual world.</li>

With the rise of these multifaceted challenges, safeguarding the integrity of European democracies has become an urgent imperative. Initiatives like EU-<a href=""https://euhybnet.eu/"" target=""_blank"">HYBNET</a>  aim to enhance preparedness and to establish a European network to counter hybrid threats.</p>
","<p>Picture a scenario in which malicious actors orchestrate a sophisticated influence campaign. In the civic space, they disseminate propaganda, manipulate narratives, and wage disinformation campaigns. Concurrently, cyber-attacks are launched, targeting critical infrastructure and government systems, seeking to disrupt operations and compromise sensitive information. At first glance, these activities may appear disconnected. But looking closely, there is an underlying influence campaign at play. This is the modus operandi of hybrid threats, which are addressed as part of the European Commission’s new <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1379"" target=""_blank"">EU Security Union Strategy</a> for 2020-2025, focussing on priority areas to support Member States in fostering security.</p>
<p>Hybrid threats can best be characterised as “coordinated and synchronised actions that deliberately target democratic vulnerabilities of EU States and Institutions”. These threats are becoming more powerful as the security environment changes, new tools and technologies emerge, and vulnerabilities are exploited in different areas in ways we haven't seen before. They employ a variety of tools, ranging from familiar ones (physical operations against infrastructure, cyber-espionage, disinformation campaigns and propaganda) to unexpected and covert methods (misuse of foreign direct investment or territorial water violation).</p>
<p>Addressing such threats requires a focus on early identification and on gaps in prevention and response measures. The Horizon 2020 security research project <a href=""https://euhybnet.eu/"" target=""undefined"">EU-HYBNET</a> aims to build a sustainable pan-European network of security stakeholders, especially security practitioners, to collaborate with each other and increase the capacity at European level to counter hybrid threats. The EU-HYBNET Network focusses on monitoring relevant developments in research and innovation with respect to countering hybrid threats, including recommendations for sound and promising technological and non-technological (e.g. training, Standard operating measures) innovations uptake and industrialisation and definition of common European requirements. The network will run until 2025 and will then be hosted by the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE).</p>
<p>Hybrid threats may be deployed to erode public trust in democratic institutions, intensify social division or impact political leaders’ decision-making. Due to their multi-faceted nature, hybrid threats can be difficult to identify and attribute to a source. As Päivi Mattila, coordinator of the project, says, “The challenge in hybrid threats is to connect the dots together”.</p>
<p>The EU-HYBNET project uses the <a href=""https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC123305"" target=""_blank"">conceptual model</a> developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and Hybrid CoE in 2021 to characterize Hybrid Threats. The model provides a way to analyse different kind of actors and understand their motives and doctrines. By gaining a thorough understanding of their objectives, the model serves as a valuable tool for foreseeing and predicting future malicious activities.</p>
<p>Recently, EU-HYBNET used “<a href=""https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC129019"" target=""_blank"">Core Model</a>” methodology in pan-European security practitioners’ and other relevant actors gaps and needs to counter hybrid threats analysis – the Core Model was developed by the JRC and the Hybrid CoE. This new model adopts a holistic approach encompassing various societal spaces (governance, civic, service) at different levels (international, national, local). It emphasizes the interactions among these societal spaces and offers means to visualise the strategies employed by different actors, the specific tools utilised, and the targeted domains.</p>
<p>Given the evolving nature of Hybrid Threats, thorough trend analysis is key. The EU-HYBNET project also has a focus on identifying the future trends of hybrid threats and addresses them in working cycles that culminate in many project’s events, especially in Future Trends Workshops. Throughout these event s and project’s working cycles, foresight exercises contribute to the initial identification of gaps and needs, as well as, in the final stage, formulating recommendations for possible innovations and solutions uptake and standardisation. Mattila explains “Our main objective is to assist European security practitioners in analysing the gaps and needs to counter hybrid threats. We aim to identify what they see as vulnerabilities and challenges in their daily working life to find technological or non-technological solutions”.</p>
<p>When examining future trends in hybrid threats, an aspect of concern within hybrid threat landscapes is the interplay between economic transactions and covert operations. A specific aspect that has received thorough scrutiny is the utilization of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to acquire land and properties in strategically significant areas, raising apprehensions regarding potential implications. According to Mattila, a significant concern revolves around understanding the processes involved in purchasing premises or land in critical areas, and how these properties can be activated for malicious activities. As Mattila underlines, the project focusses “on who is behind the money, getting control of this premise and how this can be used to foster illegal activities”. This underscores the urgency of not only understanding such threats but also developing robust countermeasures to safeguard strategic assets and curb illicit financial activities.</p>
<p>When considering the future development of criminal and unlawful activities, Mattila highlights the ongoing competition between security practitioners and malicious actors. Positive signs of success would be e.g. a reduction in the number of cyber-attacks and malicious actions and that “security practitioners would be well ahead of malicious actors in developing cyber-offensive and other capabilities”. Making this happen means creating the conditions for security practitioners to collaborate and be aware of various types of threats that go beyond conventional cyber and physical security, including vigilance against threats from unconventional domains.</p>

","<p>You are standing in front of four doors that lead you into different realities for the year 2050. The first one guides you into a world in which high-quality food is sustainably harvested through innovative solutions, providing large volumes of feedstock for a thriving bioeconomy. The second door opens to a scenario in which people drive the preferences and concerns for health and agriculture, determining what farmers can grow, and businesses must exercise the utmost transparency in food production practices. The third door leads you to a bleak setting, in which European countries are struggling to meet basic food demand and technology reigns supreme in order to mitigate this state of emergency. And finally, through the fourth door you see a society that is extremely food-technology averse, polarised, and distrustfuly of its politicians. Food choice is scarce, and prices have become disproportionate. Which door is most likely to swing open to a concrete reality? The answer could be a combination of two or more of these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is widely recognized that food production systems are expected to face significant pressure in the coming decades due to trends such as climate change, population growth, and unsustainable land use practices. Therefore, what are the ways in which crop productivity can best be equipped to resist and overcome these factors, in other words be made <em>“future-proof”</em>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cropbooster-P used a combination of scenario-building methods, stakeholder engagement, and scientific research into the current state-of-the-art in the field. These methods were used to develop a roadmap presenting the different scenarios above for future-proofing crop plants, as well as including a plan for developing and implementing the suggested research.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“In these scenarios, we are using all kinds of current trends and making an extrapolation of what direction the future will take,” </em>Klein Lankhorst notes. <em>“These four extreme scenarios remain in the boundaries of what will be possible. Of course, the real future will look like something in between.”</em> Envisioning these different realities can help determine what kinds of crop improvements are allowed or needed. The scenarios should be highly unlikely, but not impossible, and they should not overlap with each other, but rather account for a wide range of possibilities.</p>
<p>One of the key components of the project was engaging stakeholders in the conversation. Initially, plant scientists were involved in the development of these four scenarios, as well as other industry leaders from the food and plant industry. The results were then presented to the wider community, such as farmers, the breeding industry, consumers, and other scientists, who refined their strategies and the scenarios. This was done in workshops, surveys and in citizen juries, particularly to obtain citizens’  opinions on new breeding technologies, a highly controversial topic. Citizens’ juries consisted of a cross-section of the population in terms of age, gender, education, and attitude levels towards the technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Klein Lankhorst stresses that even when opinions initially differ on a subject, new viewpoints can always be formed. <em>“At the beginning, the tendency was that people were against the use of new breeding technologies, but after two days of intense discussion, they were more prone to agreeing to their effectiveness under certain conditions, such as that they are safe, affordable, well-regulated, and only used in situations highly relevant to society at large.”</em> The exercise showed that involving the broader society in complex, scientific questions by explaining the subject thoroughly, weighing the pros and cons, and leaving space for independent judgment, it is possible to come to well-informed opinions that may be different to initial preconceptions.</p>
<p>With a view towards 2050, Klein Lankhorst wonders if we will manage to increase productivity to feed a global population and if we will do this without disrupting our natural ecosystem. In this sense, foresight can help to approach concerns and action points for ecosystem degradation early on, such as employing sustainable farming, selecting climate-adaptable crops, and increasing crop resource use efficiency. <em>“It’s really important to identify these critical action points, what is important to do in the future, but also to try to find early indicators, to see whether we are heading into that kind of future.” </em></p>
<p>However, there are challenges, including the divergent time scales between policymaking and the development of biological solutions. While politicians plan for short-term mandates, plant breeding technologies and cycles take at least 20 to 30 years to develop. <em>“I tell politicians we have to start now to solve this problem by 2050. What they define as a problem is not one we can solve in a current mandate period.”</em></p>
<p>Klein Lankhorst envisions a scenario that combines ecological farming with high-tech model farming in order to increase crop yields by 2050. Ecological farming makes use of methods that promote soil health while minimising the use of synthetic inputs such as pesticides and fertilisers, while high-tech model farming integrates cutting-edge technologies and data analytics to inform decision-making. Combining the two would leverage the power of technology to create more sustainable and efficient farming systems. However, Klein Lankhorst is concerned that policymakers think along either one or the other solution.<em> ”I would really like for there to be a vision that could integrate things,”</em> He hopes. <em>“that these systems are not antagonists but can support each other and can be developed in synergy.” </em>In this way, it could be possible to increase productivity on existing agricultural grounds without touching rainforests and biodiversity.</p>
<p><em>“The lesson is that for anything that you propose, technologically or otherwise, it’s important to involve society and consider the pros and the cons and developing products that benefit consumers directly. I am for using all available technologies, but we need to involve all of society to explain why are doing this and why it is so important.” </em></p>

Led by Véronique Pouillard, Professor of Modern International History at the University of Oslo, CREATIVE IPR’s historical perspective runs  through multiple strands of research in intellectual property rights. Legal, business, economic and technological history will inform the project’s analysis of empirical data coming from unpublished archives’ materials and printed sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ERC Grant will carry on until February 2025, exploring comparative and connected histories of European intellectual property rights in the fields of fashion, music, performing arts and luxury design. Each domain is investigated through the cross-cutting themes of authorship, branding, transnational institutional frameworks, and collective organisations involved in IPR  management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collective dimension is particularly significant in shaping the evolution of IP rights from the 19th century onwards. The history of IPR in creative industries is one of negotiations and resilience in contested spaces of authorship. Behind lobbying, at different moments in time, are often professional associations and collective management societies in which authors/creators cooperate to protect their creations.</p>
<p>Drawing from her expertise in the history of fashion and luxury design, Pouillard explains how the very first battle for a patent was spurred by a timeless innovation such as the sewing machine. In 1856, key inventors of sewing machine technology chose to overcome patent disputes among themselves by agreeing to cross-license their patents, creating the first patent pool and making a significant step in cooperative patent licensing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even today, the cooperative potential of IPR can be a powerful tool to counter the ‘arms race’ to intellectual  property. According to Pouillard, the desirable way forward for IPR is to “keep copyright and patent negotiations  outside courts, promoting bi-lateral conversations, and equip authors, individually and collectively, with tools to help finetune negotiations and build adaptive cooperation arenas.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is fundamental to avoid big players spoiling the balance of representation with litigation scares that push smaller actors away. In the music industry, platformisation has changed listening patterns and a new ecosystem based on agglomeration threatens the visibility of individual artists/performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pouillard underlines how, although an enlightened use of IPR can support the safeguarding of labour rights, these qualify as fundamental human rights: “IPR can integrate and emphasise creators’ rights but it cannot (and should not) substitute for workforce protection tout court”.</p>
<p>Given its soft spot for marginalised creators, Creative IPR has looked at their struggles and investments in IPR through two main research threads: authorship regimes in French colonial and postcolonial Algeria and the role of female performers in negotiating spaces of performing rights from the late 19th century to the 1960s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project witnessed first-hand resilience’s generative power led by cooperative responses to dire times. “Especially during COVID-19 when music artists, unable to perform live, teamed up with designers on merchandise, creating new and less vulnerable profit avenues”, notes Pouillard. Post-Covid, luxury brands, following Chanel’s example, quickly bounced back by partnering with artists from other domains for shared artistic ventures”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a historian, Pouillard stresses how a future outlook on innovation must be aware of time and place. Regulations ought to be up to speed with the mutated production and consumption landscape of creative products. The Berne Convention (1886), although updated several times, remains a foundational international agreement for copyright protection. Legislative times need to pick up speed to allow IP regulation to quickly adapt and respond to rapid technological progress and changes in consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our re-elaboration of IPR must account for virtual spaces and integrate traditional copyright and trademark  rights within the expanding metaverse context. The legal dispute over an iconic Hermès handbag released in the metaverse by an individual artist as a set of NFTs establishes a precedent for how intellectual property rights may be regulated and enforced in this new digital domain. “How do we deal with the immaterial dimension where virtual representations and elaborations of physical products come to life?”, Pouillard  wonders. Who do we ‘protect’ and how?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time is also a crucial factor in the debate over shortening copyright terms. Disney's lobbying to extend rights over Mickey Mouse highlights the conflict between corporate interests and the public good, including future creators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While some aspects of innovation management and IP regulation need to be fast paced, the concept of innovation should be decoupled from high speed. “Innovation can go slower and still be robust and long-lasting” - Pouillard explains - “We have seen it with crucial inventions such as the sewing machine, the radio, the bicycle: these have all been updated and improved but have been around for a long time”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slower growth in the creative industries is tied to sustainable innovation. “We can innovate by prolonging the life of certain creations without overloading the planet”. IP regulation should focus on capturing value not just through re-production but also through re-creation. In fashion, this involves caution towards fast fashion models that encourage excessive production of ‘copies’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pouillard emphasizes the importance of place and location in guiding creative industry innovation, advocating for Europe and the Global South to foster creative alliances. Fashion is off to a happy start. “The joint campaign between high street fashion giant H&amp;M and Rich Mnisi, a young South African designer of Tsonga heritage, is a good example of the creation of branded value through spotlighting a geographically marginalized artist”,  Pouillard acknowledges. A similar partnership is that of European luxury Maison Dior and Uniwax, a leading manufacturer of wax print fabrics in West Africa, which brought traditional manufacturing expertise to the attention of luxury fashion (2) .&nbsp;</p>
<p>By highlighting the complex interplay of national, collective, and individual agency which marked the contingent evolution of intellectual property rights, CREATIVE IPR helps craft time-responsive policies that balance creators’ needs with sustainable innovation demands.</p>

Given the growing significance of these domains and related resources for states and other global and local players across a range of purposes, defining the global commons concept has become more complex. </p>","<p>A range of challenges need to be addressed in relation to global commons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to most of the global commons is difficult. S&amp;T advances and increased demand for resources is leading to increased economic and scientific research activity. As a result our planet is facing critical environmental challenges, most importantly climate change and global warming, the depletion of the Ozone layer, and rapid environmental degradation in the Antarctica. If business as usual prevails, these trends will likely worsen and will negatively impact the global commons’ capacity to provide ecosystem services for human well-being. (UN).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The danger is not just of degrading the environment, but of breaching crucial biospheric limits. Resource users need well-defined boundaries (to date 5 of 9 boundaries have been breached : climate, biodiversity, biogeochemical flows (fertilizer use), deforestation and freshwater)&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Global Commons Stewardship Index results suggest that almost all countries and regions are unlikely to achieve the 2030/2050 goals and that drastic socioeconomic system transformation is urgently needed.</li>
<li>To stay within the planetary boundaries, a radical transformation of key economic systems will be required to significantly reduce their environmental footprint. Four systems are of particular importance: the food system, the energy system, the urban system, and the global production/consumption system. Incremental progress will not be enough. Only with disruptive, systems-level change can we hope to get on the right path. Our focus should be a complete overhaul of key economic systems and development pathways. Transition management theories.</li>
<li>Managing the global commons - many gaps and challenges remain since the frameworks covering the global commons are complex and fractured.  Their management involves increasingly complex processes to accommodate and integrate the interests and responsibilities of states, international organisations and a host of non-state actors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drivers and Barriers  </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes in the related foresight drivers may influence the global commons in different ways, for example, in terms of perceptions and behaviour in relation to the resource domains. Technological change may make resource domains more accessible, geopolitical change may affect previously agreed regimes of governance, values may change with specific generational concerns, while ecological and economic change has meant that as land resources are depleted, deep sea minerals have gained in importance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key driver for the global commons is the emergence of global societal challenges, including climate change, polluted atmosphere and oceans and biodiversity loss. Widespread awareness of how these challenges are connected to unregulated, exploitative behaviour, with repercussions for social equity, quality of life and well-being, fuels the demand for climate justice. Indeed, a key driver is the view that markets can be very unfair and destructive, unless they exist within a frame of governance that ensures fairness in the community. Increased citizen discontent is becoming more evident, particularly in the use of social media to shame exploitative market behaviour and through consumer activism, boycotting brands with unethical production processes or marketing. The drive for more equitable economic and social governance frameworks extends to the younger generation with their concern for redressing past exploitative behaviour and what they consider ‘historical injustices’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals set targets for moving towards more sustainable management of the planet and its resources which has set in motion global, EU and state action. Developments in digital technologies provide the tools enabling such action. For example, ICT enabled mapping and management of global resources means that there is hardly a spot on earth that cannot be assessed and made accessible through sophisticated earth observation systems, including orbit, deep sea, or areas below the ice. The internet, including big data and satellite technology, leads to abundant knowledge. In theory, everyone on earth could access the nearly endless source of knowledge and information. In this context, open-source and open technologies are trends that drive the establishment of global commons. However, as technology allows access to previously non-accessible spaces like the deep sea, space or areas covered by ice, the pressure on raw materials increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scarcity of certain materials leads to intensified research for new materials with new characteristics and for a more circular economy, recycling and energy technology.  The abundance of resources is an equally important question which needs to be addressed since it can lead to (over-) exploitation of resources which are perceived as abundant.</p>
<p>The main barriers relate to the fact that the global governance system is becoming weaker in the face of growing conflicts and crises, as states become more concerned with protecting their interests. A potential barrier in this respect is the growing resurgence of national sovereignty, extending to economic and technological sovereignty, and the related drive to secure critical resources. The rise of new global powers with different world-views and value-systems adds to the complexity together with the growth and (geographical) expansion of global markets (powered by digital advances and competition) and their behaviour in the absence of an effective governance framework and regulation. In the worst scenario, global markets dominated by unethical players can generate unfair and destructive economic behaviour. If unchecked such behaviour can lead to exploitative practices which can set dangerous precedents.</p>
<p>While ongoing advances in information and communication technology enhance transparency in global market operations and provide more effective tools for improving governance particularly in the movement of money, however, the spread of virtual currencies and threats to cyber security, highlight the challenges faced in developing a frame of governance which ensures fairness and equitable trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether countries will renew efforts to participate meaningfully in international governance systems – the ‘rules-based order’ – or whether they will continue to shift focus to more unilateral action (UK POST study). The extent to which governments will coordinate to direct and regulate the operations of international corporations.</p>
<p><strong>Futures  </strong></p>
<p>What if knowledge, space, the sun, the sea, energy, oil, lithium, uranium, vaccines, microbes etc., became recognised as “global commons”? How will property rights be affected?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would science look like in an “open source” and “open knowledge” base?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if there is “fair” access to resources (for countries, social groups) and younger generations can influence global governance?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if there will be a return to multilateralism as a global governance principle (a multipolar world without stand-off between the big beasts)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

","<p><strong>Conclusions &amp; General Impact </strong></p>
<p>The Future of Sustainable Fashion workshop highlighted how sustainability, technology, and societal values intersect in shaping the industry’s future. Key themes included the rise of circular economy models, zero-waste manufacturing, and innovations in eco-friendly materials through biotechnology and nanotechnology, all tied to shifting consumer values toward ethical and conscious consumption. Digital technologies were seen as both enablers of modernization and potential disruptors of human connection, positioning fashion as a medium that reflects and critiques these tensions. Inclusivity emerged as equally vital, with fashion acting as a platform for identity, representation, and belonging. The workshop’s broader impact lies in promoting ethical consumption, rethinking social norms, and questioning uncritical adoption of AI. Yet barriers remain—particularly fear of change and entrenched mindsets, reinforced by education. Participants emphasized that transformation must start within families and schools, valuing “feeling over doing” and embracing experimentation as essential to progress.</p>

Bringing together 30 participants from across the European Union—including policymakers at EU, national, and regional levels, industry leaders, energy and climate specialists, and foresight and forecasting experts—the workshop explored how the EU can navigate mounting geopolitical uncertainty while accelerating industrial decarbonization on a 2050 horizon.<br><br>The discussion was structured around two core aims. First, participants examined a suite of forward-looking geopolitical scenarios, assessing how divergent power dynamics, energy trade patterns, and technological trajectories could either hinder or catalyse the transition to a net-zero industrial base in the EU countries. Particular attention was paid to supply-chain resilience, strategic autonomy in critical materials, and the interplay between carbon border adjustments and global climate diplomacy. Second, the workshop sought to surface emergent research and innovation (R&amp;I) needs and opportunities that would equip EU actors to thrive across the scenarios. Priorities highlighted include advanced electrification processes for hard-to-abate sectors, low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic-fuel value chains, circular-economy business models, and data-driven tools for real-time decarbonisation monitoring.<br><br>Outputs from the session feed directly into the Eye of Europe project’s multi-workshop learning cycle. Immediate products comprise this extended report for attendees; aggregated insights captured in the public Pilot Logbook Part I – What we did and Part II – What we learned; and distilled policy recommendations to be released in the Eye of Europe Policy Brief: Foresight Perspectives on Key R&amp;I Topics. Beyond documentation, the Insight Foresight Institute will leverage the findings to stimulate agenda-setting dialogues with EU bodies and industrial stakeholders, ensuring that identified R&amp;I pathways inform Horizon Europe programming and other EU-level funding instruments.

It focussed on exploring future dimensions and elements of contextual developments that may have important repercussions for EU R&I policies in general, and the 2nd Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe in particular. An overarching goal of the workshop, as well as the series of interactive meetings, was to provide initial impetus for a broad and in-depth discussion on the big picture and framework conditions for EU R&I policymaking.</p>","<p>Context Scenario Workshop</p>
<p>The first day was dedicated to discussing scenario elements (see Figure 1) developed in a multi-level structure and prepared by the project team based on a review of existing scenarios from different institutions[1]. The first dimension divides dynamics that relate to progress in the EU project into positive (dynamic, resilient) and negative (declining, destabilised, feeble), while the second dimension locates them on a global scale in peaceful, antagonistic, or limited collaborative relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
","<p>The first task in the workshop focussed on enriching the presented scenario elements with additional STEEP factors on different levels (national, EU, global) and on identifying challenges and opportunities arising from the scenario elements for Europe. Furthermore, we discussed contextual factors that would matter most for EU R&amp;I policies and potential changes of the respective actor’s landscape, as well as (new) actors that would be likely to take on significant roles when considering the identified challenges and opportunities. This in-depth discussion served to assess the disruptive potential of possible developments and to identify highly disruptive factors and factors with high uncertainty (see Figure 2).<br></p>
","<p>The second day of the workshop started with a voting activity: participants cast their votes for the disruption cluster with the highest future relevance. The selected clusters entailed “Moving beyond the tipping point of climate change”, “Global Relations”, “(Getting closer to) Technological Singularity”, “War”, and “European Relations”. The disruptions subsumed in one of the five selected clusters were once more assessed within smaller breakout groups. The most relevant disruptions formed the core of a “futures wheel” through which we explored potential impact of the disruption in different societal domains (global and European perspectives, industry and market, society/communities/NGOs, education, research, innovation, first responders, media, health, values, and others, e.g., law and order) and over three different time horizons (0-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-20 years). At the end of the exercise, the factors that would drive the disruption under study were identified.</p>
<p>The overall results of the workshop were summarised and condensed into a series of future narratives that present the different visions and developments as well as their disruptive potential and implications for society and especially for EU R&amp;I policy making. You will be able to read through and comment on the developed future narratives in the upcoming weeks here! We ask you for a little patience and in the meantime look forward to your ideas and discussing them further with you!</p>

<p>The track “Embedding Foresight in Next-Generation Transformative Innovation Policies”, provided a chance to integrate recent foresight experiences within the framework of a redefined STI policy context and to be inspired by exciting contributions from foresight practitioners, such as comprehensive institutional foresight programmes, international case studies, and local foresight initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foresight has attracted growing attention in recent years to inform public policies on emerging and potentially disruptive developments. This is seen in particular in STI policy, but increasingly also in other policy areas, such as industry or consumer policy. This is not surprising in uncertain times and illustrates the benefits of foresight as a tool to inform highly ambitious political agendas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the STI policy context, these agendas are geared towards addressing societal challenges through transformative and mission-oriented STI policies, but they can also be observed in other policy areas with the aim of pursuing broader transformative targets – from Twin Transitions and the Green Deal to New Industrial Policy and Smart Specialisation.</p>
<p>Highly ambitious political agendas pose difficult challenges in terms of both policy coordination and the alignment of policy strategies with those of other key actors and stakeholders. They also call for more agility of public sector organisations in responding to and adjusting policy mixes to new insights into emerging developments. The anticipatory capacity of actors and organisations i.e., the skills in and know-how on foresight approaches, is crucial for effective implementation of foresight activities and efficient uptake of foresight results, thus calling for an effective foresight community of practice.</p>
<p>In particular, the conference track titled ""Embedding Foresight in Next-Generation Transformative Innovation Policies"" was particularly insightful, as it brought together recent foresight experiences within these redefined policy contexts . In the two consecutive sessions of the track, exciting contributions from foresight practitioners were presented, ranging from comprehensive foresight programmes of the European Commission, to international case studies and AI-supported approaches, to local foresight initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presentations “How can Foresight support the European Commission to achieve the triple transition?” by  Dana Wasserbacher and “Foresight processes for the European Commission – Experiences with new process models, methods, and Foresight on Demand” by Kerstin Cuhls both focused on the foresight framework <em>Foresight on Demand</em>. The speakers used selected examples to analyze how foresight can support the European Commission in achieving the triple transition policy goal, highlighting new process models and methods currently in use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In  “Envisioning Preferred Futures: Findings from NISTEP's 12th Science and Technology Foresight” by Asako Okamura and “Future Visions for Desirable and Sustainable Plastic Waste Management in Khulna, Bangladesh”, by Jonathan Pillen, the speakers  delved into international foresight initiatives from Japan and Bangladesh, contrasting the different contexts of embedding foresight into policy making. The Japanese example presented an innovative approach for exploring individual and collective visions to understand how people imagine desirable futures in the context of the 12th Science and Technology Foresight Survey of the National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (NISTEP). This resulted in a rich tapestry of societal perspectives for the future and embraced potential contradictions or conflicts within the visions. The example from Bangladesh outlined a qualitative modelling approach using the constellation analysis (CA) method. This method enables interactive, cross-disciplinary collaboration to develop visions for transforming Khulna's urban plastic waste management system, offering a support tool for decision-makers in Bangladesh's largest city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presentation “From fuzzy futures to supported scenarios: exploring a new methodological approach to develop plausible and desirable scenarios for sustainable agricultural futures” (Presenter: Ellen Bulten) and the presentation “AI-Supported Analysis of Innovation Systems: The Case of the Electromobility Transition” (Presenter: Daniel Weiss).  In their presentations, Ellen Bulten and Daniel Weiss highlighted the difference between participatory scenario development and AI-based scenario development. Whereas the participatory approach focussed on plausible and desirable scenarios for sustainable agricultural futures and aimed at actively involving stakeholders to achieve transformative change, the AI-based approach proposed fostering electromobility transition through the quantitative and dynamic simulation of various scenarios and associated strategic options in an agile and timely manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In “Navigating Transformation: Strategic Foresight in Innovation Policy-making for Addressing Place-Based Societal Challenges” by Cristian Matti, an inspiring analysis of innovation-led strategic foresight in two EU regions (Helsinki-Uusimaa, Basque Country) and one UK region (Scotland) showed the potential of visioning to navigate regional change by tackling place-based societal challenges through realising inclusiveness of policymaking processes and thereby enabling more responsive and contextualized innovation policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, drawing on a recent example of a foresight project supporting the preparation of the 2nd Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe, the presentation “Strategic approaches to future-oriented R&amp;I policy for addressing disruptive developments” by  Matthias Weber, gave insights into different strategic paths and policy approaches for dealing with and preparing for potentially disruptive developments, such as climate change, geopolitical developments, and artificial general intelligence (AGI). The analysis showed the possibilities but also the limitations of R&amp;I policy in view of possible disruptions in technology, society and globally. The example is also instructive to show how foresight can be used to inform policy strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some, the discussion of the contributions offered the opportunity to validate their scenario approaches and gain tips and tricks for implementation, while others exchanged views on the hurdles and challenges involved in implementing foresight processes. Key findings of the contributions and discussions were, for example, the relevance of trust and the development of trusting relationships with those involved in a foresight process, but also the role of foresight as a monitoring and evaluation tool for place-based policies.</p>

But what is it exactly? And more importantly, how can policymakers use it in their daily work? These are the kinds of questions we at the EU Policy Lab (a unit of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre) often receive from people who are interested in foresight but are not exactly sure what it is and what it can do for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where to start </strong><br>To help them out, we have developed a ‘foresight menu’, for policymakers to understand and leverage foresight for more effective strategy building and decision-making. The menu describes various reasons why you would use foresight and guides the reader towards some of the tools/processes they can use. It will help policymakers clarify their starting point, their goals, and help them make the right choice about which foresight activities and processes are best suited to them. <br><br><strong>How does it work? </strong><br>Foresight - the discipline of exploring, anticipating, and shaping the future in a participatory way – can provide insights for future-oriented decision-making in many different sectors and for many different actors, not only policymakers. It seeks to navigate uncertainty and explore possible and preferable futures, not with the purpose of predicting the future, but with the intent to generate a wide variety of views on the future and understand emerging change and future possibilities. <br><br>To help anyone starting off with foresight, we first outlined the types of goals for which foresight can be used along with their corresponding foresight tools. These goals range from mapping drivers of change, understanding possible developments and changes over time to creating and exploring alternative or preferred futures and developing actions to get closer to those futures. All these foresight 'pillars' represent different steps that can be individual activities or can be part of a comprehensive foresight process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
","<p>We have also identified typical needs that are generally present in policymaking contexts, such as creating a vision, setting priorities, testing policies, or spotting risks and opportunities. The relevant foresight tools and approaches are identified for each of these policy contexts. In this way, you get a sense of both how foresight can help you reach your goals and what it can help you uncover. You can even drill down further to identify the tools and processes to be used in your particular case.   <br><br><strong>Who is it for?  </strong><br>Although the menu is primarily targeted at European policymakers, it is relevant for anyone interested in using foresight for future-oriented decision-making: both the needs and the foresight processes and tools are applicable in many other contexts and sectors, such as business, local policymaking, or civil society.  <br><br>We hope this foresight menu can empower anyone to implement foresight in their work, to ensure visions, strategies and activities are grounded in rigorous long-term thinking.  <br><br>Take a look at the menu (attached below) and get in touch: JRC-foresight@ec.europa.eu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

This intricate issue was the topic of the workshop that took place on Wednesday, 11 October 2023, as part of the series of online workshops hosted by the Horizon Futures Watch activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The heart of the discussion, a policy brief stemming from the results of deep dives conducted on this topic, revolved around four scenarios, each offering a distinct perspective on the interpenetration of criminal and lawful economic activities highlighting the role of two competing groups: criminal actors and LEAs:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neck to Neck Race:</strong> When the EU economy is thriving and law enforcement agencies have ample resources and capabilities, well-organized criminal groups are highly motivated to infiltrate lawful economic sectors. Through substantial resources, they create new technologies and methods to further integrate their illegal activities into the legitimate economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criminal Paradise:</strong> In the absence of effective regulation, the EU’s strong economy creates favourable conditions for large, well-organized criminal groups to engage in profitable activities across lawful, questionable, and illicit sectors of the economy. Lawful businesses and citizens become potential victims, vulnerable to  criminal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Safe Haven for Legal Actors:</strong> Large criminal organisations have kept a minimal presence in the EU as they found ample, more profitable opportunities in other regions where LEAs are weaker, and regulation is ineffective. In the EU, law enforcement agencies are well-equipped with resources, skills, capabilities, and supported by effective regulations, making them strong and capable of maintaining law and order.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Protected Pockets</strong>: In this scenario, there are some ‘protected pockets’ for lawful economic actors. Large criminal groups focus their activities outside the EU where they can exploit more profitable opportunities to commit economic crimes. Small-scale criminal organisations take advantage of the low intensity of the large criminal organisations’ activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scenarios considered various factors that drive individuals to engage in criminal economic activities, ranging from ""push"" factors, such as economic hardship, to ""pull"" factors, like lucrative opportunities. The scenarios explored the role of research, technological development, and innovation in creating opportunities for both criminal activities and prevention efforts by LEAs. The presentation of these scenarios opened the floor to insightful discussions regarding the brief's content and its potential consequences for European research and innovation (R&amp;I) policies and regulations. The workshop's program featured two distinct roundtable sessions, bringing together experts and representatives from Horizon projects <a href=""https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101020574"" target=""_blank"">Aligner</a> and <a href=""https://euhybnet.eu/"" target=""_blank"">EU-Hybnet</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The significance of four key policy implications outlined in the brief was stressed, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressing the substantial challenges posed by the volume of data collected during criminal investigations and the information generated by regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The need for increased traceability to enhance transparency.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The development of tools aimed at preventing, monitoring, and combating harmful criminal economic activities.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The critical importance of building trust in state organizations, particularly law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first roundtable discussion was a rich exchange of diverse perspectives and insights provided by the experts who authored the policy brief. Among the reactions, the<strong> pivotal role of supporting technological tools </strong>was emphasized to effectively prevent, monitor, and combat criminal economic activities within European Union Member States. Others highlighted the importance of <strong>establishing common ground in both policy and technology usability across various criminal justice systems</strong> within the EU. This sentiment was echoed by participants’ underlining the significance of fostering inter-state cooperation to address emerging challenges, including the spread of fake news and the links between climate change and different forms of criminal behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was pointed out that these scenarios did not include any mentions of the <strong>transformative changes associated with the Green Transition and Green Deal,</strong> which will have implications for illicit activities. The question of whether ecocide would be categorized as a crime in the future was posed. In addition, the complex connection between climate change and crimes, including human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and the dependence on illicit suppliers was brought forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second roundtable discussion centred on the regulatory aspects of technology and its ethical implications. Project ALIGNER introduced the concept of <strong>technological neutrality,</strong> advocating that regulations should target harmful actions rather than the technology itself. She also emphasized the need for continuous evaluation of regulatory effectiveness and the flexibility to adapt them when required.  Project EU-Hybnet underlined the ethical dimension of the debate, namely that it is important for technology regulations to align with democratic consensus and uphold the principles of the rule of law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>""grey zone of legality"" </strong>was also discussed, namely a situation in which the distinction between what is legal and what is illegal is not easily discernible. ALIGNER project’s team pointed out that similar tools, such as AI tools, can serve as assets for law enforcement agencies (LEAs), while also being potential means for criminal activities. There is a grey area in which these tools can be utilized on both sides, highlighting the difficulty in managing this ambiguity from a fundamental rights perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop’s scenarios and discussion carry significant implications for European research and innovation policies and regulations. By addressing the complex interplay between lawful and criminal economic activities, policymakers and stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to the creation of a more transparent and secure environment for economic activities within the European Union.</p>

<p><strong><em>Context</em></strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why people in Ancient Egypt (3100-30 BCE) wore hair wigs? Or why samurai have been associated with kimonos, while feminine full skirts are linked with the post-war America of the ‘50s? There are numerous examples of fashion items that represent specific periods and places. But what does that signify? In ancient Egypt, men wearing hair wigs was considered an honor and a symbol of equalization to women, as women were regarded as wise and sacred. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, in Tokugawa Japan (1603 – 1868), when samurai lived, clothing indicated one’s rank and role within the highly structured feudal society, while in post-war America, fashion was influenced by the idealized image of the suburban family, emphasizing domesticity and traditional gender roles. The common space of all three examples is that - throughout the centuries - fashion has served people and societies as a way of self-expression, a sign of social status, also revealing the prevailing social norms and beliefs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, our highly complex and uncertain world requires strategic tools that will help us create new sustainable development trajectories. Fashion not only reveals unique and collective identities, norms, and ethics but is also associated with environmental issues. It is one of the largest pollutant industries, prompting a shift in the way we produce and consume fashion items. How might the climate crisis change our attitudes, and how does this impact the fashion industry?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is Fashion Futuring?</strong></p>
<p>Fashion Futuring is an innovative approach that investigates potential links among objects, fiction, culture, and systems to understand how the values of the systems/societies can shape the future of fashion. It suggests a significant shift in the future of fashion approach, moving away from short-term trends and financial forecasting as primary factors for fashion production, towards sustainable, more humane means of fashion producing and consuming.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The pilot</strong></p>
<p>The upcoming pilot at the beginning of the next year is targeted towards regional stakeholders in Greece, such as citizens, CCI regional firms, and experts from academia and market and regional policy-makers. The workshop consists of a 7-stage methodology based on Garcia (2023), where participants will be encouraged to share their personal experiences and values, co-create a fictional future, and work together to design a fictional fashion item based on this future. The workshop will utilize various foresight methods, primarily core design, what-if scenario development, and strategic thinking.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2025, Helenos Consulting will organize a second pilot on the same topic, focussing on a different audience of international and national Fashion, Textile, and foresight experts, to grasp a holistic image of the topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This workshop will be implemented in Greek with citizens and other local stakeholders from Thessaloniki.</p>

The <a href=""https://projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/en/statistics/policy-support-facility/psf-challenge/mutual-learning-exercise-mle-ri-foresight"" target=""_blank"">Mutual Learning Exercise</a>  can help foster community building and foresight capacities in different member states.</p>
","<p>Foresight studies, previously known as future studies or futures research, have a rich history dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Over the years, these studies have expanded significantly in many countries, especially in the field of research and innovation (R&amp;I).</p>
<p>As we face rapid changes and uncertainty in today's world, there is a growing demand for policymakers to incorporate systematic foresight into their decision-making processes. By providing strategic intelligence and a long-term perspective, foresight can help governments better anticipate future opportunities and challenges. The OECD has emphasized the need for all governments to build greater anticipatory capacity and stresses the importance of institutionalizing the use of strategic foresight in R&amp;I policy. Indeed, foresight has proven instrumental in informing the design and implementation of R&amp;I policy through three distinctive roles linked to targeted impacts: corrective (addressing systemic failure and policy lock-ins), disruptive (focus on crisis and transition), creative (stimulating enabling conditions for new structures)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU's response to ongoing crises and future challenges involves addressing this growing demand for strategic foresight. This includes efforts to create a European foresight community by connecting national institutionalized foresight. This strategy is notably being developed in the context of the European Commission-funded<a href=""https://projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/en/statistics/policy-support-facility/psf-challenge/mutual-learning-exercise-mle-ri-foresight"" target=""_blank""> Mutual Learning Exercise (MLE) on research and innovation foresight (R&amp;I foresight).</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MLE aims to create a platform for the exchange of valuable information, experiences, and innovative practices in the field of research and innovation (R&amp;I) foresight across EU and associated countries.<strong> By fostering collaboration between different groups, the MLE seeks to inspire the development of impactful R&amp;I foresight communities as an important element of the European Research Area (ERA). </strong></p>
<p>The MLE is focussing on <strong>5 topics</strong> that have led or will lead to the publication of thematic papers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview of R&amp;I foresight.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Institutionalising foresight capability creating wide foresight communities in the R&amp;I system.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Citizens’ engagement approaches and methods.</li>
<li>Foresight, the twin transition, and potential disruptions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>From foresight for Smart Specialisation to engagement in EU Research Programmes, Missions, and Partnerships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href=""https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a75ec6db-b7ea-11ed-8912-01aa75ed71a1/language-en"" target=""_blank""><strong>second thematic paper</strong></a><strong> </strong>, published in March 2023, delves deeper into the <strong>challenges and success factors for research and innovation (R&amp;I) foresight.</strong> The paper explores how government foresight plays a role in various countries, the foresight community building process across Europe, and the main findings of a dedicated survey conducted as part of the Mutual Learning Exercise on foresight between October and November 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first part highlights the diverse approaches and experiences of Member States and other advanced countries that have contributed to an expanding role for government foresight. The paper identifies parameters that significantly influence the extent to which foresight plays a role in government, such as the country's size and location, the maturity of policy context, the level of internationalization, and the success of institutionalizing foresight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second part, the focus shifts to the European level, highlighting opportunities to create a European foresight community, building on existing institutionalized foresight at the national level. It also discusses recent strategies put in place such as the EU-wide Foresight Network, EU Foresight-on-Demand, or the Foresight Europe Network of the Millennium Project. The final part of the paper covers the key findings of a dedicated survey conducted as part of the Mutual Learning Exercise on foresight between October and November 2022.</p>
<p>These thematic papers as well as those still forthcoming share the goal of advancing the development of a community and enhancing the capacity of member states to take part in foresight and R&amp;I policy planning through enhanced knowledge-sharing, cooperation, and active learning.&nbsp;</p>

These freedoms, however, are also abused by criminal actors, significantly undermining citizens’ quality of life and the lawful businesses’ competitiveness. Further, with the advancement of technologies, citizens and businesses can benefit from new opportunities but they are also confronted with a series of problems, such as insufficient consumer protection, distorted competition, lack of environmental risk assessment or abuse of technologies. The penetration of legal economic activities by criminal actors is a far-reaching, costly abuse, which exploits new technologies developed by themselves or by lawful actors. Clearly, potential victims need to be aware of threats and make their best efforts to protect themselves. Yet self-protection alone is not enough against mighty organised criminal groups. The state needs to apply its tools – especially effective regulations and well-endowed, well-organised law enforcement agencies (LEAs) – to prevent, monitor, and fight the interpenetration of criminal and lawful economic activities. The state also needs to protect itself against corruption, tax evasion, smuggling, human and migrant trafficking, counterfeit of goods and means of payment, etc.</p>
<p>Policy-makers – working on various domains, notably regulations, home affairs, security, science, technology, and innovation (STI) policies –, therefore, need to pay close attention to possible new ways and methods for the interpenetration of criminal and lawful economic activities. With a deep dive report our aim has been to assist these policy-makers by presenting four possible futures (scenarios) on the interpenetration of criminal and lawful economic activities and considering their implications.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption of these scenarios is that the interpenetration of criminal and lawful economic activities – just as most other types of crime – cannot be fully eradicated. There are two competing groups of actors whose capacities, activities, efficacy, and efficiency largely determine the possibilities for, and repercussions of, the interpenetration of criminal and lawful economic activities: criminal actors and LEAs. The scenarios, therefore, are shaped by two main dimensions: i) whether LEAs are well-resourced, strong, and effective or not, and ii) whether large criminal organisations or small-scale ones are the dominant criminal actors. Hence, the four scenarios consider various types of ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors that influence actors to commit – or not – criminal economic activities; the main types of these activities; features of regulations; research, technological development, and innovation activities by the criminal actors vs LEAs; as well as the activities, capabilities, and resources of LEAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1 depicts a </strong><strong><em>‘Neck and neck race’</em></strong> between large criminal groups and LEAs. The EU’s economy is flourishing, it is characterised by high growth, coupled with high taxes. Due to considerable public revenues, LEAs are strong: they have sufficient resources, as well as the necessary skills, capabilities, and capacities to prevent, monitor, and fight the interpenetration of criminal and lawful economic activities. Lawful economic actors and other potential victims are protected by effective regulations that also support LEAs. While illicit actors have an almost negligible influence on regulatory processes, they nevertheless try hard to influence regulations for their interests – occasionally with some success. Large, well-organised criminal organisations have strong incentives to engage in criminal economic activities via penetrating lawful economic activities. They have massive funds already invested in the EU – in the black, grey, and white segments of the economy. They avoid paying high taxes and launder their sizeable illegal proceeds. Furthermore, they use their substantial resources to develop new technological tools and ‘business models’ to further penetrate their criminal activities into the lawful economy.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2 describes the EU as a </strong><strong><em>‘Safe haven for legal actors’</em></strong>. Large criminal organisations have kept a minimal presence in the EU as they found ample, more profitable opportunities in other regions, where LEAs are weaker, and regulation is ineffective. Stringent and effective regulation in the EU is a further disincentive for them. Some of them operate from ‘criminals’ shelters’ outside the EU and target victims online or commit online crimes mainly outside the EU but to some extent also in the EU. Small-scale criminal organisations do not possess the skills, contacts, and resources to internationalise, and thus they remain in the EU, in search of ways to penetrate lawful economic activities. LEAs are endowed with the necessary resources, skills, capacities, and capabilities to be strong in the EU and they are also supported by effective regulation. Small-scale criminal organisations are unable to influence the regulatory processes. Thus, the EU provides a safe haven for legal actors.</p>
<p>In <strong>Scenario 3 </strong>lawful economic actors rely on a number of <strong><em>‘Protected pockets’</em></strong>. Large criminal groups focus their activities outside the EU where they can exploit more profitable opportunities to commit economic crimes. Small-scale criminal organisations take advantage of the low intensity of the large criminal organisations’ activities, as well as the lucrative opportunities for criminal economic activities offered by regulatory loopholes. In particular, new technologies, as well as disruptive business models are exploited by criminals as there are no effective regulations ensuring robust cybersecurity, safety, and health standards. Lawful economic actors try to find protected pockets for their business in those domains where regulation still works. It is a somewhat ‘unstable’ scenario as lawful economic actors would push for more effective protection, and thus stronger LEAs, supported by effective regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 4 describes a </strong><strong><em>‘Paradise for criminals’</em></strong>. The economy is flourishing, and thus provides ample opportunities for large, well-organised criminal organisations to conduct profitable business activities in the white, grey, and black segments of the economy. These illicit actors successfully influence the regulatory processes to advance their interests by creating loopholes. They can also afford to fund the development of new technological tools and ‘business models’ to penetrate the lawful economy even more deeply in their criminal ways. Although LEAs are also well-funded thanks to public revenues, they are substantially weakened by ineffective regulations. Lawful economic actors and other potential victims are not protected by effective regulations. Hence, LEAs are faced with even more demanding tasks, and thus their efficacy in fighting economic crimes is reduced.</p>
<p>By considering the nature of the criminal activities that aim at penetrating lawful economic activities, and the options to prevent, monitor, and fight these crimes, the report explores a range of policy implications, especially for STI policies and regulations. Further, it stresses the multi-level nature of policy-making in the EU, as well as the need for collaboration with the willing countries outside the EU. Criminal actors can penetrate lawful economic activities in the EU when commissioned by hostile (‘rogue’) states that aim to weaken and/or undermine the EU and its Member States as part of their geopolitical power games.</p>
<p>The policy brief reflects possible implications for research and innovation as well as for the governance in the EU, particularly in the following areas:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring and foresight capabilities of LEAs in the EU and its Member States in cooperation with third countries.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Technological tools by the EU and its Member States in cooperation with third countries for anticipating, preventing, monitoring, and fighting harmful criminal economic activities identified in the four scenarios.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Joint social science research projects in the EU and its member states in cooperation with third countries to understand economic and behavioural incentives for crime and develop regulation against it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Framework conditions for effective governance and law enforcement in the EU and its member states in cooperation with third countries.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The cooperation in the EU and with third countries for more effective monitoring and assessment of criminal and lawful activities and law enforcement.</li>

But it is a misnomer for COVID-19. Despite its novel nature, the potential for such a health crisis wasn't entirely unforeseen. Foresight studies have contemplated the possibility of a global pandemic, but even a futurethinking veteran like Henk Hilderink admits COVID-19 was a ‘reality check’ for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not so much that a pandemic was unexpected, but more about anticipating its specific features. “Although it was always included in public health forecasts as a red flag, not even the foresight community was really able to conceptualise what a global pandemic would actually look like: face masks, confinement rules, the hesitation of science…”, comments Hilderink.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witnessing that kind of science fiction plot coming to life, highlights the importance of contemplating also extreme scenarios: “People, including policymakers, have a tendency to think mainstream and dismiss the worst-case outcomes”, notes Hilderink. Black swans (foresight jargon for random, unexpected, but high-impact events) are usually of less interest than the “usual suspects”, such as ageing, technology and economic growth. According to Hilderink, raising awareness about extreme events is one of the duties of the foresight community, along with the assessment of more predictable uncertainties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>COVID-19 caught us unprepared and brought attention to the value of foresight methodologies in developing resilient public health systems for the future. “The momentum to invest in foresight is there and capacitybuilding is key to promote foresight practices across Europe and lead to the institutionalisation of future thinking in public health”, observes Hilderink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirty years in the field make Hilderink one of the most experienced strategic foresight experts in Europe. At Dutch national level, he led the last two editions of the quadrennial public health foresight report published by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). At European level, Hilderink is involved in several foresight-driven projects and is president of the Foresight Section of EUPHA, European Public Health Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wealth of knowledge Hilderink is eager to disseminate. “At RIVM we are always looking for ways to transfer our foresight experience via capacity building initiatives and structured collaboration with other National Public Health institutes”. RIVM’s specific expertise has brought them to guide foresight activities for the Horizonsponsored PHIRI project, a joint venture of 41 partners across 30 European countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launched in November 2020, in the midst of COVID-19’s second wave, PHIRI (Population Health Information Research Infrastructure) sets out to facilitate cross-border sharing of population health data impacted by the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hilderink explains how “our concern in PHIRI was not only to identify the direct impacts of the pandemic but also the indirect ones”. These include the long-term effects of lower levels of care (reduced access to preventive scanning, follow-ups, and care for chronic conditions), changing lifestyles (less physical activity and increased smoking and alcohol consumption), and mental health issues (fear, stress, and loneliness of social isolation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>PHIRI’s foresight capacity-building course trained about 70 actors from across Europe through a mix of lectures, exercises, and activities. As a practical application of the vision-building training, a dozen EU Countries took part in case studies and were supported in initiating their own national foresight study on a selected public health topic, such as non-communicable diseases, long-term care, mental health and suicide prevention, and digitalisation of healthcare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expertise in foresight is quite hard to build and not all member states make place for foresight studies in budget allocations. “In the Netherlands, for example, a legal Act stipulates the production, every 4 years of a report about the future of health”, considers Hilderink.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind ‘teaching’ structured and participatory ways of looking at possible futures is the empowering goal to inspire evidence-based policymaking in public health.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Foresight experts are not policy advisors”, says Hilderink. More like landscape painters, they sketch possible futures: “There is no such thing as risk-free policymaking” – he suggests – “but the foresight community is there to outline those risks and mark uncertainties en route”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foresight process should not only anticipate knowledge-driven trends, but also create awareness about harder-to-monitor factors. “We have to consider value-driven aspects as well,” warns Hilderink, “and account for values that influence scenarios which are challenging to investigate but can have huge impacts on society”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the outcomes of public health will depend on which ‘normative’ aspects will be valued more in societal debate and echoed in policymaking. Will we privilege the economic aspects in healthcare expenditure or concentrate on safeguarding equality in health provision? What impact will value-driven choices have on life expectancy, burden of disease, and social inequalities?&nbsp;</p>

Why is there so much fuss about this simple molecule that even a whole economy should or could be built upon it?

The reaction of hydrogen (H2) with oxygen releases a lot of energy while forming pure water. In the other direction, water can be divided into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen with the help of electricity (there are of cause also other hydrogen building reactions mostly built on fossil fuels/biomass); this is simple chemistry. Compared to fossil fuels, water is nearly unlimited on the planet.</p>","<p>Hydrogen is a lightweight gas, and depending on pressure, surface or chemical binding, it can be transported, serves as a fuel and can be used for mobility, heating, chemical reactions or the generation of electricity (storage). We would have an abundant fuel based on the (theoretical) abundance of water and electricity produced by renewable energy facilities. There is no peak oil and no GHG-Emissions – only pure water and energy. This can be a game changer – assuming we get the technologies right. But let’s assume this will be the case.</p>
<p>And how will the game be changed? This is precisely what we are going to explore in our Scenario-Exercise. The key question is: How could a world (Europe) look like with abundant energy in the form of hydrogen? What are the central factors shaping the future, given that we have abundant (green) hydrogen?</p>
<p>We will have to look at <strong>global developments </strong>and the situation in the global south. For example, in Northern Africa, there is enormous potential for renewable energy – only that fresh water might be a problem. However, what if technology allows for electrolysers that can cope with seawater? And what happens to countries only with limited access to freshwater or seawater? Would that create new imbalances and potentially new lines of conflict? What about the interest of the nations in the global south? The term <strong>“new colonisation”</strong> has already been born. In addition, what happens to <strong>global power relations</strong>? What influence will the current <strong>conflict</strong> with Russia have in the future, and what are the new constellations after this war?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building renewable energy facilities requires a lot of – partly critical – <strong>raw materials</strong>. Will Europe be in the position to have access to all required raw materials? Will the <strong>oil-producing </strong>countries just wait and see? Will they transform and also become hydrogen or electricity producer? Maybe Arabian countries enter the road to synthetic fuels and can just use existing infrastructure. How will large multinational companies position themselves?</p>
<p>A closer look into Europe might cover topics like, how <strong>self-sufficient/autonomous</strong> <strong>Europe</strong> can be. Will the population accept all the <strong>renewable energy facilities</strong>? Do national and European legislation and administration allow such a <strong>fast transition</strong>? Can such a transition be just for all? Which impact will the transition towards a <strong>circular economy</strong> have on <strong>energy demand</strong> and the<strong> structure of industrial production?</strong> Which role can <strong>digitalisation </strong>play – concerning smart grids in connection with<strong> cybercrime, resilience</strong> and terms of preparedness?</p>
<p>Most of these questions relate to so-called influencing factors that will help us to ask the right questions for the future. These factors help us define and explore scenarios of a Hydrogen Economy in Europe. We will systematise the process of the identification and selection of key factors and build projections into the future of each of these key factors. Consistent and plausible combinations of the projections will build the skeleton for our scenarios. These will be enriched, assessed and evaluated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overarching guiding question for our assessments will be, in the end, what can and must Research and Innovation Policy do to support the transition best?</p>
<p>We will regularly update news about the scenario process on this platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The scenario workshops will take place online:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>8. September, 13:00 – 16:00 CEST: Selection of the key factors</li>
<li>14. September 9:00 – 12:00 CEST: Building of the projections</li>
<li>26. September 13:00 – 16:00 CEST: Selection of the scenarios and first enrichment</li>

","<p>In this brief, we <strong>explore practices and processes by which information should be exchanged between knowledge actors and policy-makers with the intention to produce scientifically informed policies in Europe</strong>. We can see an increasing prominence of science in many public debates and the increasing willingness of governments to mobilize scientific and other advice mechanisms in the context of public debate.</p>
<p>The aim of science for policy is to produce actionable science, however, the level of control over those producing the knowledge and their responsibility for the consequences of the action is a matter of important societal dispute. Debates and interactions in the political and public space encompass interest-driven channels of communication, including scientific advice but also lay knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore, science for policy needs to integrate knowledge from different sources and this requires building connections and relationships between actors from different scientific disciplines and across public administrations, affecting both the nature of science and the nature of policy-making. Science for policy may face adjustments in its modes of operation and its formats of interaction, which – at times – may well be at odds with the dominant empirical-analytical perception of science.</p>
<p>We make <strong>a deep dive into developments which are currently underway in the realm of research and innovation policy, and which can take us to different futures,</strong> including events largely unpredictable and decisions bound by constraints of diverse nature. We identify possible <strong>policy implications based on five scenarios of the future (in 2030)</strong>, which highlight different types of science for policy ecosystems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario A</strong> on <strong>societal-challenge-driven and mission-oriented research and policy</strong> provides the context for advice mechanisms to policy. Such a context can be amenable for scientific advice but it also entails risks for science.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario B</strong> on <strong>participatory science and policy support ‘under construction’</strong> opens up the discussion on broadening the sources of evidence; why and how to include new types of actors beyond the ‘usual suspects’ (well-connected experts). This has implications for how to promote science and develop the policy support system.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Scenario C</strong> on <strong>data enthusiasm and AI overtaking scientific policy advice</strong> illustrates the role of data, AI and international governance challenges and it alarms about over-reliance on multinational data providers, which may lead to a loss of transparency, autonomy and (normative) reflection in scientific advice. We should ask whether technology can be neutral, and whether scientific advice can be normative.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Scenario D</strong> on <strong>open science and policy support</strong> points out that open science is not the same as open scientific advice whereby experts can speak frankly. Useful scientific advice has characteristics of a protected space where also unpopular (but well-founded) opinions can be voiced.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Scenario E</strong> on <strong>policy-based evidence-making</strong> in incumbent-driven industrial policy increases weight on advice mechanisms and embedding data, evidence, and experimentation within government agencies, and government research and regulatory organisations.&nbsp;</li>

","<p>The study focuses geographically on Europe and looks toward 2050, on regimes of stewardship of land and sea and address the role of ownership, access and use rights in rural areas (cities excluded), multiple uses of spaces (both land and sea), biodiversity, food (both aquaculture, fisheries and agriculture), energy (use of renewables), raw materials (mining etc.), carbon removal and storage, adaptation to climate change. While the challenges are global, they are addressed especially from the European research and innovation policy perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The immense social and technological evolution of the Anthropocene continues transforming the Earth’s surface and its dynamics through extensive (mis-)use of its resources, both on the land and in the sea. This policy brief develops scenarios on rural and marine areas in Europe in 2050 and subsequent implications to today’s R&amp;I policy in Europe. <strong>Each scenario considers i) Economy and technology, ii) Demographics, lifestyles and values, iii) Governance and iv) Environment.</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>Scenario A, European Civic Ecovillages</strong> pursue self-sufficiency and contribute to establishing a cooperative, locally oriented, caring economy restoring the ecosystem carrying capacities in land and sea. <strong>In Scenario B </strong>on<strong> Sustainable High-tech Europe</strong>, European businesses enjoy global leadership in regenerative and multi-functional high-tech solutions for energy, aquaculture and agriculture. In <strong>Scenario C </strong>on the<strong> United States of Europe</strong>, centrally planned Europe is divided between intensive use of land and sea and large conservation areas. <strong>Scenario D</strong> on <strong>European Permacrisis</strong> portrays Europe in a post-growth and politically scattered context that leads to low rates of innovation and fragmented use of land and sea.</p>
<p>None of the scenarios features a decisive solution to the global climate and biodiversity crises. Scenario A forcefully targets the resolution of the biodiversity crisis in Europe, by aligning human practices with nature, but provides little support to global climate and biodiversity crises. Scenario B proactively tackles the biodiversity crisis both in Europe and internationally but struggles with the fragmentation of efforts and with scaling up good practices and wider impact to curb the crisis. Scenarios C and D with intensive use of nature reduce biodiversity. Thanks to European-wide coordination Scenario C can protect vast areas with positive impacts to biodiversity, whereas Scenario D also struggles with the major fragmentation of conservation efforts and its detrimental impact on biodiversity. Such challenges illustrate the importance of balanced approaches in developing both local and global solutions to climate and biodiversity crises.</p>
<p>All scenarios depict a future of rural and marine areas in the context of extreme weather events and ecological crises, all be it with different intensities. Social developments, instead, range from major social confrontations to more collaborative and inclusive practices. Their policy implications include, among others, the need to address major risks of patchy land use that hamper the sufficient size of ecosystems and diminish resilience. The scenarios also touch upon integrated spatial planning of urban, rural and marine areas, and how the effective use of spaces can benefit from the further extension of user rights. Future research could explore if and how land ownership models in some rural areas could be replaced or complemented with public ownership and user rights. Furthermore, policy implications include a need for balancing sustainability with food affordability and security in different modalities of agriculture and aquaculture. The challenges of climate and biodiversity crises addressed by the scenarios suggest that balanced approaches are needed in developing both local and global solutions.<br></p>
<p>This brief is the result of one of eight Deep Dive Foresight Studies in the project ‘European R&amp;I Foresight and Public Engagement for Horizon Europe’ conducted by the Foresight on Demand’ consortium for the European Commission. During the spring of 2023, an expert team identified factors of change and organised two scenario and one policy implications workshops also engaging experts from academia, business and public administration around Europe. The process was also supported by discussions in the Horizon Europe Foresight Network.</p>

Project <a href=""https://coinform.eu/"" target=""_blank"">CO-INFORM</a> applied  co-creation methods to develop verification tools with and for stakeholders such as journalists, policymak-ers, and citizens, to better prepare for situations in which the distinction between fact and fiction is not always evident.</p>
","<p>Misinformation poses a significant threat to social cohesion and the stability of communities, undermining the essential foundations of trust and informed decision-making that are crucial for a healthy, functioning democracy. When false or misleading information spreads, either voluntarily or not, it distorts public perception and skews the understanding of critical issues, leading to misinformed opinions and choices. This can have far-reaching consequences, from eroding public trust in institutions and media to inciting social unrest and polarizing communities. The spread of misinformation can also impede effective public health responses, as seen in the case of vaccine misinformation, and can influence political processes, potentially swaying elections based on falsehoods.</p>
<p>CO-INFORM, active between 2018 and 2021, took place at an opportune time to address the issue of mis (and dis) information, a time in which false facts were being spread about happenings such as the political aftermath of the Syrian refugee crisis of 2015, and as social media became the bread and butter of people’s communication and information habits. “Countries like Greece, Austria, Germany, and Sweden had a kind of first wave of migration-related misinformation, which was an inspiration for finding new ways of dealing with it in a cross-societal way,” says Mattias Svahn, former coordinator of Project CO-INFORM. Previously working at Stockholm University while carrying out the project, he is currently working at the Swedish Defense Research Agency. “When CO-INFORM started, we were researching misinformation related to the refugee crisis, but of course that developed into misinformation related to the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Such a development further pushed the project team, composed of social scientists, software developers, journalists, and fact checkers from 6 different countries, to find solutions by involving stakeholders from all facets of society in a far-reaching and integrated way. “This collaborative approach is pivotal in creating an ecosystem where information is not just consumed, but scrutinised and understood, fostering a society that is not only informed but resilient to the waves of misinformation,” says Svahn.</p>
<p>This was an innovative approach when the project started, as until then, misinformation had been approached as a somewhat separate research field from the rest of other cross-cutting challenges related to security, social services, and commercialisation. “The project was well anchored for its time as a bridge between the early research in misinformation as something specific, into an issue for all of society.”</p>
<p>The project sought to predict the credibility of sources by modelling the signals that suggest whether a particular claim is accurate or not. As opposed to accuracy, which requires human fact checkers to assess that a claim is true or not using sufficient evidence and knowledge, credibility can be modelled through automated systems that summarise various criteria for fact-checking. For example, the Washington Post uses labels such as “One Pinocchio” or “Four Pinocchios”. CO-INFORM chose to assign a so-called “credibility value” between -1.0 and 1.0 to specific claims, where -1.0 is not credible at all, 0 is neutral, and +1.0 is as credible as possible. A credibility confidence dimension was also incorporated in the model to address the probability that this label assessed the claim correctly, depending on the strength of the signals available. This depends on factors such as whether similar claims were posted in the past, whether the style of a tweet is similar to credible tweets, etc.</p>
<p>Throughout the design process, co-creation workshops were crucial. “The purpose of having a series of co-creation workshops was to have a continuous sounding board at intermittent points of the project to give input on these misinformation tools,” says Svahn. “Key moments in a design process gave influence. The co-creation workshops helped us understand how to make design choices for the best fulfilment of a design goal.” The two main products consisted in a <a href=""https://coinform.eu/tools/plugin-tutorial/"" target=""undefined"">browser plugin</a> to raise citizens’ awareness of misinforming content and a <a href=""https://coinform.eu/tools/dashboards-tutorial/"" target=""undefined"">dashboard</a> for fact-checking journalists showing what kinds of misinformation is detected and how it will spread in the near future. Svahn adds, “In the beginning, the tools available were largely confined to the technological realm, primarily utilized by software engineers. Nowadays, these tools have become more mainstream, opening the door to wider adoption and integration into various aspects of daily life.”</p>
<p>The project was not without its challenges, however; while tools can be developed to predict and detect the credibility of a claim, how misinformation can spread in the near and far future remains a greater question mark. “How do you know when or where a particular group is going to begin spreading misinformation?” Svahn asks. He mentions the concept of “pre-bunking”, or metaphorically, “inoculation”, of people against misinformation, as a potential solution. This analogy draws from the medical practice of vaccination, where a weakened or inactive form of a virus is introduced to stimulate the immune system to fight the disease. Similarly, in the context of misinformation, vaccination involves exposing people to misinformation that may come in the near future to help them recognize and resist false or misleading information when it is there. However, experimental setups are far from a realistic simulation of reality. “It’s easier to talk about pre-bunking or inoculation but it is harder to deal with in actual practice.</p>
<p>For instance, there have been false claims about social security services abducting children in Sweden. To address this, Swedish authorities have engaged with various groups and stakeholders across Sweden, helping them see first-hand how these narratives are completely unfounded and disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>Svahn envisions a future where every segment of society recognizes the significance of misinformation and collaborates effectively with key local stakeholders to address this challenge. This involves schools, public organisations and commercial companies. He also hopes that big social media platforms can be incentivised to tackle the spread of misinformation first-hand. “Facebook algorithms are geared towards stimulating interaction, and an angry one at that, which is equally financially viable as a positive interaction,” he notes. He makes a reference to EU laws such as the Digital Services Act. “These new laws are a step in the right direction to incentivise social media companies, without whose participation the containment of misinformation cannot go forward.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, he cautions a worst-case scenario: “When narratives get a life of their own, they become disconnected from the topic that they originally started with. Misinformation is a corrosive influence in society, and combating it is not only a way to create a more resilient society, but also a safer society.”</p>

By changing the way we see and perceive the future, it offers us the possibility to decolonize our imagination, question our perceptions and worldviews, and ultimately, promote change</em>, writes Amerissa Giannouli in her <a href=""https://interaliaproject.com/decolonizing-your-imagination-futures-literacy-for-change/"" target=""undefined"">“Futures Literacy for Change”</a>-Article (2021). <a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/group/archaeolog/cgi-bin/archaeolog/2020/12/16/futures-literacy-how-to-decolonize-the-future/"" target=""undefined"">Michael Shanks (2020)</a> also sees decolonising as part of futures literacy, with the task of undermining path dependency (only being able to think in the terms of the past) so that new futures can be imagined.</p>
<p>Dr. Vanessa Andreotti, guest at the aforementioned event, already points out the breadth of the use of the term in 2016 <a href=""https://decolonialfutures.net/multi-layered-selves/"" target=""undefined"">as part of her Decolonial Futures collective</a>: <em>Decolonization has come to mean many different things in different contexts, and, although this is to be expected, Indigenous scholars have taken issue with certain uses of the term. In any case, it is very important to ask questions about what assumptions, politics, and theories of change inform the analysis of colonization and the invocation and desire for decolonization in each context of use.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Decolonisation has a historical background that is larger than the metaphor</strong></p>
<p>Using the term without context can mean reproducing the issue actually addressed by the term. <a href=""https://clas.osu.edu/sites/clas.osu.edu/files/Tuck%20and%20Yang%202012%20Decolonization%20is%20not%20a%20metaphor.pdf"" target=""undefined"">Tuck and Wayne Yang already point out in 2012</a> the struggle on which the notion of decolonisation is based: <em>Decolonization brings about the repatriation of Indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. The easy adoption of decolonizing discourse by educational advocacy and scholarship, evidenced by the increasing number of calls to “decolonize our schools,” or use “decolonizing methods,” or, “decolonize student thinking”, turns decolonization into a metaphor.</em> Seen in this light, a superficial, non-embedded use of the term could be detrimental to the actual cause.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The discursive coupling of decolonisation and the Anthropocene</strong></p>
<p>The Decolonizing Futures Initiative is an independent global initiative founded by Pupul Bisht - <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pupulbisht_sdgs2030-unga76-futures-activity-6846106927240400896-FE9z/"" target=""undefined"">mentored by Cat Tully</a> (also a guest at the upcoming event) - that utilizes non-western folk storytelling as a tool for inclusion of marginalized voices, and cultural knowledge about the future in order to inform &amp; inspire inclusive decision-making, planning, and innovation. <a href=""https://medium.com/copenhagen-institute-for-futures-studies/decolonising-futures-with-pupul-bisht-b1245ac416ff"" target=""undefined"">Pupul Bisht (2020)</a> brings important points to the discussion on decolonisation and the anthropocene: (...) t<em>he fatal images of the anthropocentric narratives, which tend to put humanity at the centre of the universe with the planet at our disposal and us being the central and superior species. To decolonise the way we practice foresight and the way we engage with futures is a very intentional decentring of Anglo- and Eurocentric ways of knowing, which tend to be dominant in the discourse.</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0263775818764679"" target=""undefined"">Simpson (2020)</a> suggests in his analysis how an anthropocene discourse can be less colonialist: He hopes to problematize taken-for granted logics that operate silently in the background of current debates by asking what ways of being, forms of knowledge, and ways of relating the Anthropocene concept occludes, delegitimizes or constraints.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Futurists, ask the powerful questions of decolonisation!</strong></p>
<p>So instead of making a dichotomous distinction between ""colonised"" and ""decolonised"", <a href=""https://superrr.net/2023/06/13/recap-superrrlabgoesrp23.html"" target=""undefined"">Sara Bolgharian recommends</a> at a Re:publica talk (2023) organized by Muslim Futures (a project of Superrr Lab) not to always want to replace every existing concept, but to consider the interconnectedness - all thinkers and histories are always connected anyway. Recognising this is at the core of decolonisation.</p>
<p>So if we want interconnected Futures4Europe, committed to thinking in alternatives and colonizing as little as possible, the Futurist-Communities need to be both: merciful and strict in negotiating with dominant political institutions like the European Commission, the Council or the European Parliament (<a href=""https://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2023-2/vol-28-no-1-september-2023/decolonizing-futures-practice-opening-up-authentic-alternative-futures/"" target=""undefined"">see Kevin Jae1* 2023</a>).</p>
<p>This is also explained by Maruyama et. al. in their book project <a href=""http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1659943/FULLTEXT02.pdf"" target=""undefined"">""Decolonising Futures: Collaborations for New Indigenous Horizons""</a> (2022), in which the majority of contributors, including artists, participated in the 2017 International Conference on Policy towards Indigenous Peoples in Sapporo<em>: Although United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) is presented here as the subject of our book, we must ask: does it truly speak the Indigenous language? Does it represent the language of decolonization? </em>Decolonisation amplifies the voices historically sought by the powerful to dislocate.</p>
<p>Jewlya Lynn and Jen Heeg discussed a related issue in 2021 at the <a href=""https://aea365.org/blog/decolonizing-evaluation-week-changing-the-future-the-transformative-potential-of-decolonized-foresight-practices-by-jewlya-lynn-and-jen-heeg/"" target=""undefined"">Decolonizing Evaluation Week</a>: <em>Are you ready to bring foresight into your evaluations in ways that break out of our Western mindsets? To change who is centered, not just in the story, but also as the “expert” bringing the method forward? To step back and create room for new futures to emerge?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What Futures Studies has learned after 50 years of engaging with decolonisation</strong></p>
<p>Robert Jungk, one of the founding members of the World Futures Studies Federation (WFSF), which is committed to thinking in alternatives, wrote as <a href=""https://www.amazon.de/Zukunftswerkst%C3%A4tten-Phantasie-gegen-Routine-Resignation/dp/345303743X"" target=""undefined"">early as the 1980s</a> about the need to oppose the colonisation of the future by one-sided technocratic forecasts and planning. He found that those affected want much more humanity and less technology. The problem, he said, is that the meaning of new technology without participation is often not oriented towards those affected (people and nature).</p>
<p>Jaes Paper (<a href=""https://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2023-2/vol-28-no-1-september-2023/decolonizing-futures-practice-opening-up-authentic-alternative-futures/"" target=""undefined"">2023</a>) deepens the historical view of decolonisation discourses in Futures Studies. A short excerpt: Jim Dator, former president of the WFSF, campaigned strongly for a decolonisation programme in Futures Studies in the early 00s, because he perceived desirable futures as difficult to negotiate, since dominant ideas of the future were anchored in the discourse by powerful actors as almost fixed. Inayatullah took up Dator's point in 2013 and summarized it as “The future is not neutral”. Both share a vision of Futures Studies as a vessel through which the future can be decolonised. The water for this is the participatory involvement of those affected by issues.<a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764298042003009"" target=""undefined""> As early as 1998</a>, Inayatullah pointed out: Case Studies and Courses show the necessity of decolonisation to enable thinking in alternatives. To better understand the human condition as futurists, research should always be multileveled, empirical, interpretive and critical. Only one year later, Sardar (see Jae) emphasized the need to think about alternatives based on non-Western agency and to develop independent frameworks. I would like to sketch some of these in the next chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Different approaches and methods from practicing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.diplomacyandcommerce.rs/sohail-inayatullah-the-future-becomes-a-space-for-reinvention/"" target=""undefined"">Inayatullah: Used Futures und CLA</a>: <em>Indeed, for many nations, the only hope forward is to leapfrog, to resist purchasing used future, and instead change. Futures seen in this lens is about decolonizing the past. The past often becomes the key barrier. Board directors often say, “but we have always done it this way.” (...) Using the method CLA or causal layered analysis, we change the narrative, the story that gives meaning.</em></li>
<li>Pupul Bisht (<a href=""https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154171898.pdf"" target=""undefined"">2017</a>): <strong><em>Reimagining one-size-fits-all futures, one story at a time</em></strong><em>. (...) Just like many other Indian stories, the Kaavad represents past, present and future fused into one. There are images of real people/ patrons who are dead and gone, patrons who are living, the saints like Kabir who once existed and then there are gods that are eternal. So it accommodates all kinds of time and all kinds of spaces. The artifact in itself represents coexistence of many time periods within one space and within one story.</em> Inspired by Kavaad, Bisht has developed an inclusive storytelling tool.</li>
<li><a href=""https://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2023-2/vol-28-no-1-september-2023/decolonizing-futures-practice-opening-up-authentic-alternative-futures/"" target=""undefined"">Jae1 (2023)</a> explored the question of what futurists can do to include non-standard ways of thinking and knowing in their projects. Five key themes were identified and described: 1. Methodology, 2. Project design, 3. Role of the futurist, 4. Futures through others’ worldviews, 5. Decolonising hegemonic time</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.cmu.edu/cas/initiatives/narrative-initiative/decolonized-futures.html"" target=""undefined"">“Decolonized Futures” (2017-2021)</a> was an interdisciplinary project that aims to examine and dislodge dominant and oppressive settler colonial narratives. The project’s title refers both to the political project of decolonisation and to Indigenous Futurism. The term “Indigenous Futurism” was coined by Grace Dillon after “Afrofuturism.” Indigenous Futurism centers Indigenous cosmologies through a storytelling framework that creatively and aesthetically interrogates the history of settler colonialism, critiques contemporary Indigenous contexts, and re-visions a decolonised future.</li>

<p></p>
<p><strong>My personal take on the current state of the decolonisation debate</strong></p>
<p>The future(s) is not neutral. Participation opens up alternatives. This is well known - and yet often too few non-Western stakeholders are involved, as indicated by the many voices from all parts of the world mentioned in the article. Decolonisation is a difficult term. It has a history as a term that must be taken into account. Name it: Subjugation of other regions.  But there are also risks in “metaphorical” decolonisation, as the discussion about the western-influenced anthropocene approach shows. Decolonisation projects should always keep in mind whether their activities are perceived as colonisation by others and face the negotiations.</p>
<p>Numerous initiatives currently exist around the world that engage with decolonisation, and their numbers are continuously increasing while offering more and more concrete solutions to swing the pendulum more and more in the direction of ""decolonised"". It is time to connect the learnings even more and in a more systemic and solidarity-based way. If aspiration and practice continue to stimulate each other well, then the project of decolonisation can make a significant contribution to a better world for all.</p>

These challenges affect everyone, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, and range from the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, to pandemics, food and energy shortages, large-scale forced migration, rising domestic and global inequality, and escalating armed conflicts. In this context, there has been an alarming stagnation in progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The rise in public debt levels in many low- and middle-income countries is concerning. The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General's 2023 special edition report on SDG progress underscored that the next five years are critical, as failure to achieve the SDGs could lead to even greater poverty and inequalities, political instability, economic upheaval, and irreversible environmental damage.<br><br>Yet, many countries are facing challenges in ensuring that their governance systems are capable of addressing these complex and interconnected challenges. A need for better governance, effective policy integration, sustainable investment choices as well as effective use of public resources, including Official Development Assistance (ODA), - as well as better international governance of SDGs - to meet sustainable development needs has never been more urgent. Delivering these improvements will require unprecedented action and decisions from public institutions and political leaders, effective and inclusive multilateral cooperation, with the goal of uniting diverse stakeholders to deliver nothing short of a rescue plan for people and the planet, in line with the call to action made by the UN Secretary General.<br><br>As countries approach 2030, there is increasing recognition that the SDG commitments to “leave no one behind” and “reach those furthest behind first” need to extend beyond this timeline. In this context, the UN Summit of the Future presents a unique opportunity to tackle both current and future challenges, with a view to enhancing global collaboration on critical issues. The OECD’s policy work and active global engagement demonstrates its commitment to support all countries to individually and collectively achieve this objective.<br><br>This Report aims to provide OECD support to inform decision making ahead of the UN Summit of the Future and following high-level events. It leverages OECD knowledge, data, tools, instruments and good practices to support national and international actions to respond to future challenges and opportunities. This report addresses two major breakthroughs proposed in the UN Secretary General's Rescue Plan for People and Planet: equipping governance and institutions for sustainable and inclusive transformation, and prioritising policies and investments with multiplier effects for sustainable development. It also aligns with the bold actions outlined in the anticipated Pact for the Future, addressing three of the five key priorities: sustainable development and financing for development; science, technology, innovation, and digital co-operation; and youth and future generations.<br><br>Governance for equitable and sustainable transformation<br><br>Transforming governance systems for sustainable development requires overcoming sectoral silos and policy fragmentation, as well as setting practical, and where feasible, ambitious and coherent economic, social, and environmental objectives that extend beyond short-term political cycles. Establishing robust policy coherence mechanisms is therefore needed to harmonise policy priorities and promote collaboration where most effective, with a view to reducing policy fragmentation, ensuring mutually reinforcing policies across sectors and government levels, and minimising negative transboundary effects of domestic policies.<br><br>Sound governance for sustainable transformation also calls for the strategic use of various government tools - such as strategic foresight, people-centred public policy, mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, regulatory policy, public procurement and budgeting – in order to build resilient, sustainable and inclusive societies. It also calls for ensuring information integrity and providing access to justice for all, which are critical for the sound implementation of individual rights and government commitments.<br><br>Effective governance systems also require the alignment of public investments with the public interest and sustainability priorities, including through the use of existing planning tools, such as National Sustainable Development Strategies, National Development and Decarbonisation Plans, strategic public investment decisions to foster inclusive and sustainable futures, stimulating further investments from private and other sectors, and leveraging transition finance to build resilient infrastructure and other strategic sectors. Integrity and building trust are also core objectives, crucial for fighting corruption and illicit financial flows, essential for effective public service delivery and sustainability. There is also a need to develop and maintain regulatory frameworks that facilitate compliance with SDGs, including the integration of the SDGs across the regulatory cycle and enhancing regulatory co-operation. In addition, developing new measures of progress that focus on both people and the planet will be crucial to a more holistic understanding of global economic prosperity and progress beyond GDP. To this end, the newly established International Forum on Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD) could play a pivotal role.<br><br>Finally, adopting a territorial approach to the SDGs is essential as cities and regions play a critical role in promoting a paradigm shift towards sustainability. At least 105 of the 169 SDGs targets will not be achieved without proper engagement and coordination with local and regional governments. The SDGs provide the appropriate framework to define and shape local and regional development visions, strategies, plans, and re-orient existing ones towards sustainable development.</p>
","<p>Policies and investments for sustainable transformation<br><br>Sustainable transformation requires prioritising policies and investments that are mutually reinforcing and can catalyse progress across social, economic, and environmental dimensions, serving as multipliers to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs. This includes closing divides to leave no one behind, through strengthening policies and investments for social inclusion and identifying areas where social inclusion initiatives can be pursued in synergy with environmental protection. A key example of this is pursuing universal social protection, in light of its significant multiplier effects across different SDGs and incomparable potential for promoting just transitions. In addition, leveraging environment-human-well-being synergies is essential for coherent and effective SDG implementation. This requires enhancing transition finance credibility, strengthening domestic enabling conditions, addressing the labour and distributional impacts of climate policies, accelerating access to clean energy, and protecting biodiversity. In addition, there is a need to strengthen measures to protect lives in disaster situations by aligning disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation responses.<br><br>Additional financing for sustainable transformation<br><br>Delivering an SDG stimulus requires innovative and collaborative solutions to unlock and scale up all sources of financing – public and private, domestic and international – for sustainable development and to address interlinked global crises. These need to harness productive trade and tax revenues, as well as international flows, to support SDG financing, including through innovative financing mechanisms, ensuring that financial flows, trade, development co-operation and other policies align with SDGs and promote inclusive and equitable outcomes, as well as encouraging green budgeting, developing effective tax policies, and improving tax administration, including via digitalisation of tax processes. This may also include innovative forms of financing, such as targeting support to enhance co-operation between public and private financial institutions through blended finance instruments, green, social, and sustainability bonds, and local currency solutions. Once again, integrity, compliance, anti-corruption and the fight against illicit finance are crucial for effective domestic resource mobilisation and attracting additional external financing from both private and public sources.<br><br>Science, technology, and innovation (STI) for sustainable and inclusive transformation<br><br>It is essential to design and implement STI policies in a manner to address societal challenges and achieve sustainable transformation, as set out in the OECD Transformative Agenda for STI Policies. Promoting trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) is critical for digital transformation. AI is a powerful, versatile technology which has the potential to transform how we work, learn and interact, boosting productivity and economic growth and accelerating progress towards addressing global challenges, such as food security and climate change. However, we also need to address the risks raised by AI technology, including those related to privacy, safety, security, human rights and AI-generated disinformation and manipulated content. Beyond AI, policy efforts needed in the area of digital transformation also include enhancing broadband connectivity; achieving well-performing digital health systems through digital technologies; and, strengthening data governance frameworks while upholding human rights, including women’s and girls’ human rights, which face additional risks in the digital sphere. Strategic foresight should be used for anticipatory and innovative policy exploration about multiple futures, including by assessing emerging critical risks and opportunities in the face of various technological advancements and their implications on our economy and society. Strengthening data governance frameworks will be essential to ensure high standards of data protection, and facilitate data access and sharing across jurisdictions, including in the public sector.<br><br>Empowering youth for a more equitable and sustainable future<br><br>Addressing the needs and rights of youth and future generations is crucial to achieve sustainable development and intergenerational justice. This requires policies that promote formal job creation, high-quality employment services, and support for youth entrepreneurship, as well as social protection systems to meet the specific needs of youth, access to affordable housing, and outreach to vulnerable and disadvantaged young people.

This blog post summarises EUARENAS future-thinking work that used social media signals as its starting point to explore the future of democracy.</p>","<p>Whilst social media is not necessarily a reflection of society and, like traditional media, they are a distorted representation of current trends rather than a mirror image, they can still help us to understand what is happening in society. Social media accounts connected to social movements can provide us with signs of what issues and debates are pertinent to people (as opposed to institutions). They offer us a glimpse of emerging forms of citizen participation and action.</p>
<p>Such content can be useful for thinking about the future. As part of EUARENAS, we used social media posts and aspects of the Delphi method to explore the future of democracy in Europe. Three national studies were undertaken in the UK, Finland and Poland, with a fourth study taking place with experts from across Italy, Hungary and Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>Signals for the Future: UK</strong></p>
<p>This study suggests that <a href=""https://www.coproductioncollective.co.uk/news/what-is-the-value-of-co-production"" target=""_blank"">co-production</a> – not faux-production – could be a vital tool for enabling participation in democracy, particularly for people who are currently excluded. To enable inclusion in democratic action, inclusive language is needed (e.g., language that is simplified, jargon-free and not academic). More so, there should be an emphasis on independent voices sharing stories and lived experience as part of these processes so that different perspectives and types of knowledge are included and valued. The work also highlighted a need to ‘join-up’ grassroots movements with more mainstream democratic organisations in order to progress agendas – at present people seem to be in their silos and progress is not as quick as many would like. Thus, an emphasis on calls to action is needed – not just awareness-raising.</p>
<p><strong>Signals for the Future: Finland</strong></p>
<p>The social media content demonstrated that there are rising demands for equality, inclusiveness, sustainability, and all-round approaches in democracy. However, there is a polarisation of political views on social media sites that work against this. They are being used as opinion-sharing platforms, rather than spaces for people to exchange ideas. The experts felt it is possible to re-imagine how technology like social media can create spaces that promote dialogue between different perspectives. This connects to a ‘call for action’ within the social media posts themselves – a need for education on critical thinking was identified. This could support people to better understand and assess information and media content, as well as engage in public discussions and not become entrenched in their position/perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Signals for the Future: Poland</strong></p>
<p>The study suggests that the financial crisis and the war in Ukraine make it seem less possible for citizens to engage in democracy. More so, the posts also displayed a sentiment of a lack of trust in any type of media and in governance structures – this was also expressed by the experts themselves. In a similar way to the findings from the UK, the posts and expert discussion around them identified that there is a lack of inclusive language on social media when talking about democracy. To engage with the general public it was felt that posts should be simple, not academic and gender-equal. Furthermore, like in the UK work, the posts highlighted a sense that talking was not enough, action needed to be taken – there was an urgency around this, perhaps ignited by the invasion of Ukraine. Finally, like in Finland, the social media content identified a strongly polarised “discussion” concerning democracy. This polarisation is something that local democracies need to address to build stronger communities and cohesion in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Signals for the Future: Multi-location (Italy, Hungary and Portugal)</strong></p>
<p>This study highlighted how local administrations need to mirror the bottom-up process of citizen engagement displayed by associations, neighbourhood committees and active civic initiatives. However, there is space to innovate in this arena. Participatory projects are focused largely on urban parks or the management of the green areas – these need to spread to all aspects of the community. It was felt that people who give time to such initiatives need to be recognised with rewards or pay back schemes. Finally, in terms of education, this work identified that support is needed to help people and organisations to utilise social media as an effective means of building campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>So, what are the key takeaways for building a better future for democracy?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inclusive language</strong> – Remove the initial barrier to entering into this conversation by making language (text and visuals) more accessible and inclusive when discussing democracy and/or promoting initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration as the norm</strong> – Breaking down the silos between different groups, organisations and institutions and embedding ‘alternative practice’ within existing systems to catalyse change.</li>
<li><strong>Creating critical, curious minds </strong>– Using education and learning as a tool to equip people with the skills to assess content and information in the digital world, and develop the capacity to stay curious, seek to understand different perspectives and be open to changing their mind.</li>
</ol>

As on previous occasions, it is being published in a year when the European Union embarks on a new five-year institutional cycle. The report analyses the key global trends towards the year 2040 and their possible impact on the Union, and sets out some strategic choices and questions that Europe's leaders may need to address in the coming five years and beyond. The report is the product of a unique collaborative process over the past year involving officials from across the nine ESPAS institutions and bodies.<br><br>The report sets the centrality of geopolitics as a transversal trend, given the on-going shift from an era of cooperation to an era of competition as well as the deepening fragmentation of the international system and the acceleration of major global transitions. The Report highlights how the borders between EU internal policy and external policy are blurring nowadays and will probably blur even more in the future. The primacy of geopolitics is outlined across the various trends identified in the report: from the economic challenges to demography, from the environmental and climate crisis to the energy transition, from the quest for equality to the technological acceleration, and including health, democracy and the broader changes on how we live.<br><br>The publication concludes by outlining the strategic imperatives for the incoming EU leadership. It calls for a multifaceted approach to establish the EU as a smart global power, ensure a socially equitable green transition, navigate economic risks, update the economic model, innovate within a balanced regulatory framework, and strengthen social cohesion.<br><br>Between now and 2040, Europe and the world will undergo profound geopolitical, economic, technological and social change. The generation now growing up will live in a world that we can only imagine. However, integrating long-term goals into short to medium-term decision-making can boost our chances of leaving a world that is in better shape to the next generation. The more we understand the challenges ahead, the better we can anticipate and prepare for the changes to come. There are grounds for optimism. The EU has arguably been able to make progress in the past precisely when the challenges seemed overwhelming. When pressed, it can marshal reserves of determination and ingenuity. The next EU leadership will need to draw deeply on these reserves in the years ahead.</p>

<p><br>Signals for the workshop were gathered from experts, literature review, and text/data mining of patents, publications, and EU-funded projects. These signals were then scrutinised for their sig-nificance to the field's future by a diverse group of sector experts which led to the identification of nine key topics: accelerated material design/synthesis; biomaterials as part of the circular economy; advanced materials allowing new applications; closed loop battery recycling; innova-tions in catalysis; organic batteries for sustainable energy storage; design to performance bat-teries; design to cost batteries; and electrochemical water treatment. Furthermore, the workshop identified additional wild cards with high novelty and disruptive potential such as: circularity of materials (safe and sustainable by design); membranes / separators; process optimisation; 3D printing of electrode materials for energy and environmental engineering applications; and use of AI for the study of materials.<br>Participants also highlighted various factors that could influence the development, adoption, and promotion of these emerging technologies, which can be grouped under the following categories: governance and compliance frameworks; funding; collaboration and knowledge exchange; sustainable and efficient development; infrastructure and technological advancement and limita-tions; industry and market dynamics and constraints; innovation and risk management; supply chain and raw materials; and talent development.</p>

<p><strong>About this episode - On engaging meaningfully with futures</strong></p>
<p>Often framed as a professional activity essential for 'planning', guiding 'decision making' or 'orienting strategies', futures studies could be more generously placed in the realm of humanities where, along other human capacities, imagination and anticipation should be nurtured and celebrated.<br><br>In this light, futures education is more like a tending a garden. Like doing the soil work that turns it into the fertile ground for seeds to grow into 'flowers' such as human creativity, a heightened awareness of the mechanisms of change, agency coupled with humility, a sense of taking part into shaping something yet non-existent.<br><br><strong>Peter Bishop</strong>, founder of Teach the Future, argues that this garden should be welcoming everyone, including young people, or perhaps especially them.</p>

Based on participatory workshops and a foresight deep dive, the policy brief presents four alternative scenarios and their implications for R&I policy.</p>","<p>Climate change and environmental degradation are existential threats to the European Union and to the world. As a response, the EU has pushed for a green transition with, among other things, the European Green Deal and its aims of making Europe climate-neutral by 2050. If followed through, the transition towards greener and more sustainable economies is a game changer in the EU labour market alongside digitalisation and automation. Skill needs will change with impacts far beyond the key occupations driving them. In fact, more or less all economic sectors will be affected.</p>
<p>To succeed, Europe needs to promote and support green employment, address the skilling and reskilling of workers, and anticipate changes in workplaces of the future. In order to get a better grasp on potential future outcomes, and better anticipate their potential policy implications, a foresight Deep Dive was carried out with the main findings presented here.</p>
<p><strong>16 alternative futures devised, four elaborated in further detail</strong></p>
<p>The expert team, with input from stakeholders and workshop participants, initially produced a scenario matrix based on four dichotomic dimensions. The dichotomic dimensions relates to the state of the environment in 2050 (positive extremes, negative extremes), EU's ability to provide global leadership in green solutions and technologies (positive and negative extremes), the supply of a green skilled workforce in Europe (high and low supply), and, finally, the demand for a green workforce (high and low demand).</p>
<p>The scenario matrix produces 16 alternative futures from which four were chosen by the expert team and the scenario participants for further exploration. The policy brief identifies key features from the four scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<strong>Scenario A: Green technology-intensive Europe:</strong> Struggling to fill all the green jobs. Here, the European Union has advanced in a green transition across society and, as a result of the effort, has gained global leadership in green solutions. New green technologies and the consistent need for reckoning with past environmental damage and past climate change emissions (i.e. adaptation to rising temperatures and reactions to adverse weather events) accelerates demand for green skills. However, with European demographic developments there is a low offer of green skilled workers and a struggle to fill all the green jobs. The key challenge of the skills ecosystem is to match the high demand for green skills.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario B: Apocalypse Soon</strong>: Fighting skills mismatches in a degraded environment. Here, Europe plays a leading global role in green tech with booming exports, but the environment is in a critical state in Europe and globally. Society is polarised as some industrial sectors are booming, while a majority of the European population struggles with deteriorating living standards and increased damages from natural disasters. The capacity of states and non-green sectors to provide skills training has been limited, reinforcing labour market polarization and trapping companies in non-green sectors in vicious cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario C: Feeling the pain</strong>: A workforce left behind in a non-green world. This scenario represents increasing environmental pressures from man-made climate change that have not been effectively addressed over the past decades. The EU is a follower, not a leader. People in 2050 are dealing with rising temperatures, accelerated loss of biodiversity and nature, increased pollution, and more adverse weather events. A significant number of green jobs concern themselves with adaptation to system pressures and even systems breakdowns, i.e. limiting the negative impacts of environmental damages. This has impacted jobs because EU employers have little demand for green skills. The main industrial and innovation organisations are based outside Europe and are using remote working and technology to undertake many job roles and tasks. Over the past three decades, people have been investing in green skills believing that these will be in demand. However, the state of the EU green market means that many of these skills are now redundant or outdated. Consequently, there is an oversupply of green skilled labour from those already in the labour market and those seeking to enter it.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario D: Green leapfrogging</strong>: Old, mismatched Europe surrounded by new green giants. In 2050, third countries and regions have leapfrogged leaving Europe behind. The world has seen geopolitical shifts, but also an improved environment. Young people leave the EU to work in countries with positive green agendas. Countries within the EU begin to align themselves with non-EU green leaders rather than promote unity from within. Towards 2050, EU is in ‘catch-up mode’ trying to restructure the economic and skills ecosystems towards modes more aligned within planetary boundaries and with the green, global development trends.</li>
</ul>
<p>The four scenarios purposefully explored potential extremes within the dominant scenario dimensions. Together, they highlight that there is no certainty for the long-term development of the supply or demand of green skills on the European labour market. Rather, the supply and demand will be shaped by the outcomes of certain key factors and through key policy choices of the present and of the near-future.</p>
<p>The policy brief did highlight several other key findings deemed relevant across the various development paths. First, each scenario highlights the importance of a strong, vocational education and training (VET) skills base. The brief stresses that the category of green jobs, now and in the future, encompasses both low, medium and high-tech professions. An R&amp;I policy underpinning green skills should therefore consider various levels, not just frontier (green) technology development. Beyond the design of the solution, a VET base with transferable skills and short-term skills programming is important for the solution's societal deployment and uptake. A resilient workforce ready to take on 'bolt-on' skills quickly will also be highly sought after if changing weather conditions increasingly requires rapid responses for which needs are difficult to predict years in advance.</p>
<p>Another feature across the scenarios is the uncertainty related to the label 'green'. Looking back from 2050, people will likely question parts of what is today categorised as green. Our shared understanding of what green means is reconfigured over time. European R&amp;I policy should devise mechanisms that can reflect - perhaps even anticipate - such shifting value attributions. If there is not such a reassessment mechanism, there will likely be overinvestments in technologies and solutions that ceases to be considered as green improvements.</p>
<p>Finally, the scenarios address the need for stronger international cooperation for the development of green skills. Climate change and environmental challenges require global uptake of solutions. An isolated Europe is unlikely to lead to positive outcomes for both environment and (European) employment simultaneously. In the more optimistic future outcomes, a key defining challenge will be to make the green labour market more diverse and inclusive. This is a challenge that European R&amp;I policy would do well to take up already today.</p>

In a fascinating anarchic creative environment, young artists are invited to create original artworks in one week under the guidance of an established artist. At the same time, curators are invited to set up the exhibition just hours before the official opening.</p>","<p>As if the usual complexity wasn't enough, this year's Inspire 2023 brought a number of innovations and new complexities. Double in size this year, it hosted 40 young artists working under the guidance of two lead artists Mikhail Karikis and Albert Barqué-Duran. Also, this year by focusing on the theme of the future, INSPIRE attempts to create a framework for the collaboration of art and future studies by attempting to lay the groundwork for similar collaborations in other scientific areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea for this year's theme was initiated by Areti Leopoulou, curator at MOMus, when we met 3 years ago, at Reworks Agora 2019, where I was presenting the Millennium Project's research on 2050 and Albert (Barqué-Duran) was presenting experiments of art creation (painting and music) in zero gravity conditions. Discussions about the exhibition began immediately, however, the pandemic postponed the project several times, and eventually found myself having the dual role of MOMus president and futures expert (UNESCO Chair &amp; Millennium Project).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The futures lab </strong></p>
<p>The main role of the UNESCO Chair was to enable the dialogue between art and ""science"" and lay the groundwork for artists to explore and envision different alternative futures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using as a source of inspiration the 3 scenarios for 2050 composed by the Millennium Project, a full-day participatory workshop was designed where artists used foresight tools to explore different futures and learned to look into the corners for useful ideas, because the future, we will eventually experience, is usually created at the margins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as part of the futures lab, the artists understood the way each one envisions the future differently by traveling through one of Polak's quadrants, spotted megatrends/trends/weak signals/black swans, created alternative future scenarios using Dator archetypes, and created their future selves by playing Cadavre Exquis, a famous surrealist game. Finally, once they felt ready, the 42 artists navigated through the Millennium Project's scenarios for 2050 and put some flesh to them by using the Harman fan method to create, in complete silence, newspaper headlines for 3 different futures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The INSPIRE exhibition will be open until the 30th of September 2023 at MOMus-Museum of Contemporary Art in Thessaloniki, Greece</p>

Today, there is an urgent need to discover and cultivate new ways of thinking and creating to respond to the numerous challenges that have risen in recent decades.</p>
<p>There are different paths to instil new ways of thinking. <strong>Art thinking</strong> is one of them that has been employed in various disciplines to stimulate divergent thinking by generating and posing critical and clever questions. Often, it serves as a catalyst for redefining our relationships with existing paradigms, norms, and routines. Art-tech collaborations, as collaboration between artists and scientists or companies, have been initiated to drive technological and digital development while reflecting on societal and environmental impacts of innovative technologies. Bringing different disciplines together can infuse innovative thinking and unconventional approaches, where art thinking is used to pose critical questions about current paradigms of innovation.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>design thinking</strong> has also found widespread application within companies as a problem-solving and human-centred approach for designing creative and innovative solutions. Design thinking brings iterative approach and experimentation to the process of innovation by placing a strong emphasis on understanding current human behaviours, needs and attitudes.</p>
<p>While art thinking helps generate critical questions about innovation, and design thinking helps generate innovative solutions for current needs, how can we ensure that innovation remains relevant for the future challenges? There is a pressing need to move away from short-term thinking, both for society as a whole and for companies in particular - to ensure that new products and services are designed to meet future needs, challenges and opportunities, sustainably and ethically. As a response to this, <strong>Futures thinking </strong>is a mindset and approach that fosters thinking about multiple futures in a systematic way. By adopting a future-oriented mindset, a company can proactively identify potential opportunities and threats that will shape its landscape. Futures thinking also provides a framework for both - strategic planning to consider the long-term implications of innovation, and imagining a wide array of alternative futures that can potentially unfold and impact the process of innovation.</p>
<p>Merging Design, Futures, and Art thinking is the focus of MUSAE project. MUSAE aims to define an innovative collaboration model (Factory Model) to integrate artistic approach in the (European) Digital Innovation Hubs (E-DIHs) through a Design Futures Art-driven (DFA) methodology to help companies to anticipate innovative products and services for the future of food to improve human and planetary well-being. One of the main pillars of the Factory Model is the Design Futures Art-driven (DFA) method - a combination of Design Futures method (Design and Futures Thinking) and Art Thinking approach.</p>
<p>The DFA method aims to facilitate the innovation process between artists and companies, encompassing various tools and activities. Alongside strategic tools that effectively guide the design futures process by scanning trends and signals, creating alternative futures and constructing scenarios, the DFA method also integrates emotional exploration as a fundamental artistic contribution that guides both artist and company throughout the whole process. Finally, the DFA method establishes a format for artist-company collaboration throughout the process, allowing them to align on common objectives, vision and follow the progress together.</p>
<p>The DFA method will be implemented and tested during the first MUSAE Art-Tech S+T+ARTS residency starting from September 2024. Stay tuned to know more about the results of the DFA method on our website <a href=""https://musae.starts.eu/"" target=""_blank"">https://musae.starts.eu/</a>.</p>

Uncertainties about how people will work in the future—how they will earn their income and build meaning and purpose through their jobs—are important concerns and often a source of anxiety.<br><br>Where are different industries and sectors headed? What is possible, and what is likely regarding the evolution of professions by 2030? Which of these developments are desirable? What can universities and the business sector do to facilitate these changes? These questions motivated our research.<br><br>This study encourages <em>futures thinking</em>, understood as <strong>an informed exploration of the</strong> <strong>evolution of a set of professions across various fields</strong>. These professions were identified through a dedicated process that included, among other methods, horizon scanning—tracking societal and technological trends that are shaping the global labor market.<br><br>The set of<strong> professions expected to undergo significant transformation by 2030</strong> was the focus of participatory exercises, fulfilling the foresight function of <em>debating the future</em>. Through interviews with diverse stakeholders—employers from various industries and coordinators of academic programs relevant to the professions analyzed—we aimed to integrate different perspectives and interests into discussions about future developments and strategic choices. This debate was further expanded through a broader online consultation using the Dynamic Argumentative Delphi method, which examined both the expected demand for each profession by 2030 and the adequacy of the current educational offer to meet this demand.<br><br>In addition to these foresight efforts, the study presents an <strong>analysis of higher education specializations in Romania relevant to the professions of the future</strong>. This is illustrated through visual representations of the trends in university graduates who could enter the identified professions.<br><br>Through these efforts, we approach the <em>future-shaping</em> function of foresight, which translates into strategic advisory support, integrating insights from both individual and institutional actors into policy-related knowledge. Moreover, this approach aims to facilitate the implementation of public policies by fostering networks, knowledge platforms, and other foresight intelligence infrastructures.<br></p>

Strategic foresight guides the formulation of policies that are robust and adaptable in the face of uncertainty. It facilitates the establishment of shared objectives, the reframing of policy issues, the early detection of emerging trends, the rigorous testing of existing policies, and the fostering of innovation for better outcomes.<br><br>Recognising the importance of strategic foresight, the European Union has significantly invested in developing its capabilities and networks and enhancing the resilience and recovery efforts of regions. OECD research underscores the importance of adopting a multi-level strategic foresight approach, fostering synergies and collaboration among different governmental actors to address global challenges. This requires a departure from traditional hierarchical structures towards more adaptive, multi-level and multi-actor frameworks that can effectively navigate uncertainty.<br><br>The Government of Flanders, Belgium, is undertaking to strengthen its strategic foresight capacity to improve resilient policymaking. This report assesses the current state of strategic foresight initiatives within the Government of Flanders, examining their depth and systemic integration. The report also offers tailored recommendations to enhance the system.<br><br>To date, Flanders’ strategic foresight endeavours have focused on project-based initiatives with a primarily regional scope. OECD analysis suggests that efforts to embed strategic foresight more systematically across government are still in their infancy. The report outlines key insights across five critical dimensions of strategic foresight: demand and mandate; capabilities and skills; institutional arrangements; integration into the policy cycle; and mechanisms for feedback and learning.</p>
","<p>The main findings underscore several critical areas for improvement in strategic foresight for the Government of Flanders:<br><br>- Build a stronger case for strategic foresight. While strategic foresight is increasingly integrated into government initiatives, its potential as a core function is still unrecognised. There is opportunity to highlight its benefits by observing how the Government of Flanders has successfully used strategic foresight methods to explore and solve problems.<br><br>- Establish clear mandates for co-ordination: Horizontal co-ordination is essential to breaking down silos and addressing cross-sectoral challenges effectively. An explicit mandate for co-ordination can facilitate this process and ensure strategic foresight initiatives are aligned with overarching goals.<br><br>- Ensure leadership support and commitment: Leadership endorsement is vital for fostering a culture that values strategic foresight. Leaders should create an enabling environment for experimentation, knowledge-sharing and resource allocation, drawing upon regional and international networks for insights.<br><br>- Provide tailored training for officials: Comprehensive training programmes can enhance understanding and appreciation of strategic foresight among elected and non-elected officials. They should address biases about foresight work and promote its effective use across government.<br><br>- Develop guidelines for multi-level strategic foresight: Policymakers require clear guidance on how to incorporate multi-level strategic foresight into decision-making processes. Concrete instructions and manuals can facilitate this and ensure consistency in its application.<br><br>- Allocate dedicated resources: Adequate resources, including funding, time, and expertise, are crucial for building and sustaining strategic foresight capabilities within government. This investment is essential for internal projects, external collaboration and professionalisation efforts.<br><br>- Integrate foresight into policy priorities: Strategic foresight needs to be closely aligned with policy priorities and strategic planning processes. Demonstration cases and flagship projects can illustrate this alignment, while continuous monitoring ensures the integration of long-term perspectives into policymaking.<br><br>- Clarify the role of public administration: It should be explicitly stated that strategic foresight is a fundamental component of policymaking, ensuring that long-term challenges are adequately considered when presenting policy options to decision makers.<br><br>- Enhance engagement with stakeholders: Engaging with academia, civil society, businesses, and other stakeholders is essential for enriching long-term policy planning efforts. Collective intelligence and collaboration can enhance the effectiveness of strategic foresight initiatives.<br><br>- Develop a multi-level anticipatory intelligence system: Strengthening international partnerships and data-gathering capabilities are critical for establishing a resilient anticipatory intelligence system. The system should seamlessly integrate current indicators with evidence gathered through strategic foresight methodologies.<br><br>These findings on the Government of Flanders’ strategic foresight system serve as a foundation for further development, culminating in the co-creation of a blueprint for promoting strategic foresight practices within the region.</p>

Here is a country leading the way by setting out how to reach a zero-carbon future.</p>","<p>In brief, there are 10 “bricks”<a href=""https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/0bbe2e34-e503-441a-af9e-4fc70c17e6af/database/data/contact117/57e22264-a640-476a-a27d-2bab6b9a261d#_ftn1"" target=""_self"">[1]</a> (components or steps in the vision) that are designed to “build the house” (the vision as a whole that ensures Luxemburg is <em>more resilient</em>, <em>more inclusive and more competiti</em>ve). Resilience includes the use of foresight to make the country more agile (constantly looking for changes coming, and learning from them), a much greater focus on adaptation to climate change by ensuring that vital resources/services have back-ups and developing a greater strategic autonomy with a zero-carbon footprint. The latter especially requires a combination of stimulating the circular economy (reducing the need for new resources), increased efficiency in resource use (less for more) and greater sobriety in consumption (with a greater role to a shared economy and social/solidarity economy). The vision also promotes digitalisation to dematerialise the economy and make it more competitive but insists that digital’s social and ecological footprints must be handled. Diversification is important to remain competitive, and whilst keeping a focus on financial services, other sectors, notably, health will receive support. Indeed, people, and especially young people, are at the heart of the economy, and economic activity should address their needs, and ensure they are equipped to deal with any big upheavals that occur. To ensure the much of the above is done, it will be important to mobilise big budgets, and thus to find new sources of revenue. Competitivity can further be improved by shortening procedures and distances that need to be covered. For a country with open borders, keeping diplomatic pressure for European and global rules to cover important issue also remains vital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would stress three things here:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>From a methodological point of view, it is important to note that the vision was not born out of the heads of a few people. This process involved 6 working level workshops (usually with 40-60 participants), several higher-level workshops, multiple workshops with stakeholders (industry, business, trade unions, communes), a public opinion survey (and ""town hall meeting"") and additional interviews. Naturally it was a challenge to channel all these inputs constructively, but the team rose to the task. Moreover, the team did not jump straight to creating a vision. Instead Luxembourg Stratégie developed three plausible scenarios (and one wild card) for futures in which Luxemburg may have to live. Having done this it was then possible to identify the ""no regret"" policy options and indeed, new opportunities appeared on the table that would not have been thought of before. This means that the vision bricks have been wind tunnelled for robustness in different scenarios.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The vision addresses a big problem we face in the move to a zero-carbon economy, which is how to take the majority of citizens with you when trying to make root and branch changes to the way we run our economy. As we have seen with the gilets jaunes in France, and the more recent screams against eliminating gas and oil heating systems in Germany, once citizens’ comfort and wallets are at stake public opinion seems no longer give a damn about their personal contributions to climate change.  The challenge will be even bigger when entire industries need to adapt. The approach taken is therefore to prepare the citizenry to take advantage of the new economy, rather than being stuck in the old.  Indeed, it is not a question of somebody ""placing"" citizens at the centre of things - they - and especially young people – will have not choice but to be front and centre in the coming years. The key thing now is to make sure they are empowered and equipped to deal with this new type of world.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It was vital to have a unit in government that pushes this reflection forward. Luxembourg Stratégie has played that role - and been the lightening rod for criticism that the government is daring to think ""out of the box"".

<p>i. Improving open strategic autonomy to renew national production: an economy less dependent on imports and shocks to international markets and strong national production are assets;</p>
<p>ii. Applying circularity and sobriety throughout the economy and society: circularity and sobriety contribute to greater autonomy in production and consumption, as well as decarbonisation and efficiency in the use of resources;</p>
<p>iii. Putting young people and knowledge at the heart of the economy: societal and organisational innovation can be a lever for developing business creation, employment and social cohesion, and for meeting new social needs;</p>
<p>iv. Reconciling the digital, ecological and social transitions: while digital technologies can facilitate the emergence of a more sustainable future, they also have a significant environmental footprint and shape our social relations;</p>
<p>v. Investing in critical redundancy, strategic storage and mission-critical solutions: if the economy is to be more resilient in the face of shocks and recover more quickly from disruption, essential goods and services need to be stockpiled and protected;</p>
<p>vi. Simplifying procedures, shortening paths, facilitating transfers: improving the business environment for entrepreneurs, investors and researchers by streamlining procedures, to invigorate the entrepreneurial culture and attract talent;</p>
<p>vii.Adapting the healthcare system to new challenges, an economic opportunity: we need to anticipate new pandemics and new disease vectors and use the digital transition to reduce costs and improve the quality of care;</p>
<p>viii. Adopting an integrated strategy of sustainable economic diplomacy: forging strong diplomatic and commercial links with other countries that share our values, to make the many transitions we face more successful;</p>
<p>ix. Ensuring sustainable and solid public finances: in a context of multiple transitions requiring major investments, long-term programming of public finances is essential;</p>

What innovations are reshaping urban transportation for passengers and goods? What key policy recommendations should be included in future mobility planning? </p>
<p>Project <a href=""https://sprout-civitas.eu/"" target=""_blank"">SPROUT</a>  (Sustainable Policy RespOnse to Urban mobility Transition) aimed at envisioning future mobility scenarios, developed an interactive toolbox for urban policymaking and issued recommendations to aid cities’ transition to sustainable mobility and handle disruptive innovations in the sector. </p>
<p>SPROUT adopted scenario-building techniques, assessments of replication potentials, and policy compliance checks to make sense of the rapidly changing urban mobility environment influenced by societal challenges. </p>
<p>Horizon Futures Watch asked the SPROUT project coordinator, Maria Teresa de la Cruz Eiriz (Zaragoza Logistics Center), to expand on SPROUT’s city-led, forward-looking approach and explain how the project used the lens of foresight to create an understanding of the current state of urban mobility and identify the main drivers of future change. </p>
<p><strong>What was the foresight component of your project?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of SPROUT‘s objectives was to trace the parameters driving urban mobility transition and foresee their impacts. Urban mobility transition drivers were identified following the PESTEL approach (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political) to trend analysis. This activity, along with the exploration of the current state of mobility, provided the basis for the creation of “do-nothing” scenarios (absence of specific mobility policy interventions) for the SPROUT pilot cities in the 2030-time horizon. Local stakeholders were invited to join workshops (Local Innovation Forums) to envision city-specific narratives in the event of no policymaking actions to manage local urban mobility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What kind of stakeholders/community did you engage with? Is your approach to science-policycitizens dialogue replicable at EU levels and for different policy fields?  </strong></p>
<p>SPROUT set up a community of cities organized in three layers (pilot, validation and associated cities), collaborating together towards more sustainable and innovative policymaking on urban mobility. On top of the scenario-building activities, SPROUT analysed the implementation of ten different mobility solutions (for freight and passengers) in 15 cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders were identified jointly with the cities considering the specific mobility solution based on the question: ‘Who affects or is affected by the urban mobility transition’? Generally speaking, the main stakeholder groups were public administration, conventional public transport operators and “new mobility” providers, technology companies, energy providers, logistics operators, users, residents, and local businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such city-led approaches can be successful if awareness and engagement among stakeholders is high. Lately, participatory techniques and co-creation have become buzzwords, but results depend very much on the Credits: Freepic methodology applied. Science-policy-citizens dialogue must be very well structured and expertly led to ensure inclusivity, avoid bias and make the most of co-creation activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What key results have you obtained? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of policy-mediated approaches in the so-called ‘no intervention’ urban mobility scenarios helped convey the message that transition in urban mobility is essential to embrace the change towards sustainable transport. But the ‘how’ mattered the most to SPROUT. The concept of city-led innovation empowered city leaders and decision-makers to develop policies able to steer the introduction of innovative solutions and accompany these solutions for an impactful (and more legitimate) implementation. Based on this approach, we have developed an urban policy model to enhance evidence-based local policymaking and capacitybuilding tools and recommendations to support cities in urban policy design and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What key elements from your project do you think could improve science-policy-stakeholders dialogue in practice?  </strong></p>
<p>The development of local communities and their involvement in the planning process is an important success factor both to identify the appropriate policy and for it to be widely accepted by all local city stakeholders. SPROUT’s outcomes highlighted the need for creating Open Innovation Communities as innovative crowdsourcing models promoting knowledge generation, debate, and consensus building among local and EU-level stakeholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If things go well, how would you expect urban and mobility policy to develop in the next 20 years and what would be the signs of success?  </strong></p>
<p>Uncertainty lingers. The post-COVID-19 mobility landscape is bound to depend greatly on the evolution of the energy  market in Europe and how it impacts the political agenda. Data-driven and flexible mobility policies are the way forward to achieve sustainability goals and accommodate the market of new mobility solutions. Ideally, cities should have a co-created vision for the future and build a stable roadmap towards it; one that doesn’t change every few years due to its dependency on politics!&nbsp;</p>

The importance of this topic and its relevance for the green transition was underlined by its many interpretations. Its definition is often difficult to grasp, as the meaning of ‘green’ is comparative and constantly reconfigured. The urgency of meeting the need for green skills, through workforce up-skilling and reskilling, in order to thrive in greener jobs in the future guided the workshop. A broad definition of green jobs was shared early on, taking into account (i) new and emerging green occupations; (ii) green and enhanced skills and knowledge occupations and (iii) green increased-demand occupations.</p>
","<p>The green transition’s potential to lead to important implications for reskilling was a key concept running throughout the workshop. In many places, the lack of green skills may in fact be a barrier to the green transition, but there is also ambiguity on what the green transition actually is and which skills it depends on. This uncertainty set the scene for an exploration of the future and for understanding how research policy can approach green skills and jobs. The relevance of green skills spans beyond research and innovation, touching on education, industry, and environmental policy.</p>
<p>The policy brief introduced by the expert team assessed what the green jobs landscape might look like in 2050 and pointed to the existence of 571 skills and knowledge concepts labelled as ‘green’ which cut across all sectors of the economy, ranging from information to communication and management roles. These include new and emerging green occupations, green and enhanced skills and knowledge occupations, and positions in high demand due to green practices.</p>
<p>The proposed scenarios considered dimensions such as environmental pressures, EU leadership in green technologies, along with demand and supply of green workforce, to generate 16 alternative futures. Four of these were examined in more depth:</p>
<p>A – <strong>Green, technology-intensive Europe</strong> – struggling to fill all the green jobs</p>
<p>B – <strong>Apocalypse soon</strong> – fighting skills mismatches in a degraded environment</p>
<p>C – <strong>Feeling the pain</strong> – a workforce left behind in a non-green world</p>
<p>D – <strong>Green leapfrogging</strong> – old, mismatched Europe surrounded by new green giants</p>
<p>In response to the above scenarios, the workshop discussed overarching themes concerning the interaction between humans and the environment, as well as between humans and technology. The discussion also explored what defines a 'quality' green job and considered the integration of these concepts into R&amp;I policy and the management of related uncertainties. One participant proposed taking into account the fluctuating numbers of incoming and outgoing workers from the EU.For example, if expertise in carbon capture is not locally available, it may be necessary to source this specialized knowledge outside and draw it into the EU. Therefore, green skills and jobs could be viewed as workforce flows, rather than as static sectors and fixed competencies.</p>
<p>Another participant identified the need to harvest the necessary ability to accompany change processes across all sectors. For example, farmers would need guidance to adopt less chemical-intensive methods and must possess the adaptability to frequently reassess their practices.</p>
<p>In their foresight exercise, the experts concluded that a circular economy would likely result from either intense, crisis-driven pressure, or unprecedented cooperation among current industry players. A major requirement is, therefore, cross-sectoral collaboration, thinking in terms of value chains instead of single products. Additionally, the real challenge lies not just in identifying the necessary skills but in determining who will ensure the training and development of these required skills. This would call for an investment in specialised education, making a compelling case for employers to invest in reskilling their workforce. Thus, a synergy between innovation and educational institutions is essential to equip the workforce with future-oriented skills, including AI and data science expertise.</p>
<p>In the second part of the workshop, perspectives on the scenarios were shared by various foresight project representatives. <a href=""http://wetransform-project.eu/"" target=""_self"">WE TRANSFORM</a>, a project researching the skills needed for the transition to automated mobility, suggested that the scenarios could have depicted not only probable futures but also aspirational ones. Thus, illustrating pathways and actions necessary to achieve those preferred futures would have enriched the scenarios. This point was also echoed by the <a href=""https://www.connectedfactories.eu/"" target=""_self"">Connected Factories Project</a>, whose aim was to identify the enablers and cross-cutting factors of sustainability and manufacturing through specific pathways. According to this project, the scenarios presented were valuable not just for road mapping, but also for potential risk analysis. The assessment of AI’s potential impact on the scenarios was considered a relevant addition to make, considering the topic’s prevalence in the discussions.</p>
<p>Consequently, the <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/statistics/policy-support-facility/psf-challenge/mutual-learning-exercise-mle-ri-foresight"" target=""_self"">MLE project</a> pondered on how the EU could maintain control amid growing environmental vulnerability, appreciating the scenarios’ consideration of the relationship between humans and machines, and the implications these dynamics have for the relationship between digitalization and sustainability. A similar point was also made by <a href=""https://www.sf4s-project.com/"" target=""_self"">Strategic Foresight for Sustainabilit</a> project representatives, emphasizing the need for continuous learning and stressing the importance of narrative skills for highlighting transformation points across industries.</p>
<p>The workshop underlined the potential complexity of green skills agendas, acknowledging that while technology will certainly play a key role in the future of green skills, our ‘solution’ lies in our ability to innovate responsibly and integrate technology with sustainable practices.</p>

The workshop aimed to anticipate the societal and policy implications of integrating smart and digital technologies into assisted living and care for older adults. Using the futures wheel method, participants explored future developments across three main areas: institutional long-term care, home-based care, and the inclusion of individuals with special needs in the workplace. The workshop was structured around three future assumptions for the year 2035, envisioning that AALT will become standard practice in long-term care facilities, widely used in private households, and successfully integrated in workplaces to support employees with special needs. Through this anticipatory approach, the workshop identified overarching effects of AALT on society and highlighted the importance of these technologies in shaping future policy and innovation strategies. This workshop was part of a broader series of foresight pilots designed to engage diverse stakeholders, test foresight methodologies, and contribute lessons to the Eye of Europe community and its online foresight platform.

These disruptions are not predictions, but hypothetical future developments identified through extensive research, expert consultations, and workshops. The Strategic Foresight Toolkit features a five-step foresight process, guiding users to challenge assumptions, create scenarios, stress-test strategies, and develop actionable plans. It includes facilitation guides and case studies to support effective implementation. Each disruption is accompanied by insights on emerging trends, potential future impacts, and both immediate and long-term policy options to ensure resilience and preparedness. Designed for policymakers, public administrators, and foresight practitioners, this publication is designed to promote holistic, strategic and evidence-informed decision-making. It aims to support countries and organisations in using strategic foresight to design and prepare robust and adaptable public policies for a range of possible futures. With its practical methodology and forward-looking approach, the Strategic Foresight Toolkit is a vital resource for building sustainable, resilient, and effective public policies.</p>

We encourage them to regard the future as a malleable and  constructible set of possibilities. This attitude is in stark contrast with people- the youth included- feeling they are witnesses to the future unfolding, or merely in the position to  adapt to change as it occurs. Future minded students are the ones exploring, imagining  and deliberating potential futures. Students with entrepreneurial ambitions are invited to  use the tools in this kit to go even further than imagining and debating the future; they  are invited to co-create futures that are desirable for the ecosystems/communities/ clients they aim to serve.<br><strong>We trust this foresight kit for entrepreneurial minds will provide useful guidance for  young people interested in shaping the future. While this is an intellectual journey aimed at university students, the kit is meant to support facilitators in organizing and running a  foresight experience. </strong>Thus, the kit describes the procedural steps for organizing a foresight process for  students interested in generating entrepreneurial ideas that may address the challenges  and opportunities of the future, as opposed to merely speculating the opportunities of  the present.</p>

","<p>Integrated assessment and energy system models are challenged to account for societal transformation dynamics, but empirical evidence is lacking on which factors to incorporate, how and to what extent this would improve the relevance of modelled pathways. Here, we include six societal factors related to infrastructure dynamics, actors and decision-making, and social and institutional context into an open-source simulation model of the national power system transition. We apply this model in 31 European countries and, using hindcasting (1990–2019), quantify which societal factors improved the modelled pathways. We then demonstrate how this hindcasting could be used to inform forward-looking national electricity system transition modeling (1990–2050) to assess the socio-technical feasibility of achieving emission goals. This work paves the way to a more systematic and objective selection of societal factors to be included in energy transition modeling. <br>The webinar will conclude with a 15-minute question and answer (Q&amp;A) session.</p>

<p>Foresight is about thinking long-term to make smarter choices now. It is a collective effort to look beyond the present and consider what could happen in the future. Foresight isn’t about gazing into a crystal ball, but a way to methodically broaden our perspective and prepare for different possible futures scenarios.</p>

","<p><strong>Can you briefly describe your relevant background?  </strong><br>I am working as a researcher at Finland Futures Research Centre. I have a background in Political Science, but I joined the FFRC in 2017 and have been working with foresight and futures studies since, often with European or EU-related projects.<br> <br><strong>What is your role in the Eye of Europe Project and what are you currently working on? </strong><br>I am leading Work Package 4 on Futures Literacy, and the target for our work is to expand futures thinking among non-experts. A key part of this, as we see it, is to move foresight ‘beyond text’ – that is, foresight not just as long text-based reports, but also something accessible through other mediums. One thing we are working on in that regard is a set of videos that introduce foresight and futures thinking, for example to those about to participate in a foresight workshop, but with little prior experience with that particular foresight method. <br> <br><strong>What will in, your view, be the relevance of foresight methodologies for European innovation in light of recent geopolitical and economic developments worldwide?</strong><br>I think foresight underlines participative aspects, the negotiation between different interests and perspectives, and the importance of viewing issues from multiple sides. In that, it has a democratising element. In times where democracy and understanding of others seem to come under increasing pressure, I think the values implicitly inscribed in foresight methodologies become ever more important. Perhaps they can also become something like Europe’s secret weapon in comparison with world regions rather less interested in participation, democracy, etc.<br> <br><strong>What is a piece of foresight-related work or publication that you would recommend to read, either in academia or in popular culture? </strong><br>If it was up to me, every politician in Europe would be forced to read Jonathan White’s recent book on The Future as a Political Idea. At least, if some foundation out there is reading this and is interested in investments safeguarding democracy, please start by sending a copy of this book to every member of the European Parliament and the European Commission.<br> <br><strong>Imagine you’re living in 2050. What’s one groundbreaking innovation or societal shift you think might define that world?</strong><br>I was recently part of facilitating a workshop, where participants were asked during an icebreaker exercise to invent a new emotion. Someone came up with combining empathy with something more action-oriented and coined it ‘actionpathy’. It was not my invention, but I haven’t stopped thinking about it, and I hope it defines the world we live in in 2050. At least, I hope it defines who I will be in this 2050 world.</p>

","<p>TechEthos aims to produce ethical guidelines that can provide orientation for technology developers in the early stages of development. We spoke with project coordinator and innovation policy expert Eva Buchinger and foresight expert Wenzel Mehnert about their considerations on the outcomes and process of their project. Both are working at the Austrian Institute of Technology.</p>
<p><strong>How does strategic foresight fit into the work of the TechEthos project?</strong></p>
<p><ins>Wenzel:</ins> Strategic foresight is about defining or creating knowledge to orientate actions in the present. If we want to develop innovation of new and emerging technologies responsibly, we need some kind of knowledge or guidelines to orientate our action. I think here TechEthos plays an important role as it creates those guidelines.</p>
<p><ins>Eva:</ins> Strategic foresight in the case of TechEthos contributes to ensuring high interest in ethical standards in the EU and beyond. Thus, we want to help reinforce the pivotal role of the European Union as an ethical trailblazer. Reconciling the needs of research and innovation and the concerns of society and reflecting them in ethics guidelines is essential for TechEthos’ strategic approach.</p>
<p><strong>Why should these vital concerns be at the forefront of technology design?</strong></p>
<p><ins>Wenzel:</ins> New and emerging technologies always create new opportunities, such as generating wealth or general socio-economic benefits. However, they also present potential <a href=""https://www.techethos.eu/analysis-of-ethical-issues/"" target=""_blank"">ethical challenges or unintended social consequences</a>. In the context of disruptive technologies, there are always people who benefit from these technologies but also those who will lose. This is why we need to reflect on how to achieve a positive societal outcome. One way to do this is by constructing scenarios with stakeholders, thinking about positive visions. But often, these visions vary from one stakeholder to another.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your guidelines and to whom they are targeted.</strong></p>
<p><ins>Eva</ins>: In TechEthos, we analyse existing ethical guidelines and frameworks and provide suggestions for their enhancement. We specifically focussed on guidelines related to TechEthos’ technologies - climate engineering, digital extend realities, neurotechnologies – and selected two guidelines per tech, which are in the process of enhancement that we are now finalising. Concerning target groups, TechEthos is a CSA (coordination and support action) and so it was clear from the beginning that we had to deliver orientation for EU policy makers. Another target group are research ethics bodies organised in institutions such as the European Federation of Academies of Sciences and Humanities (ALLEA) and the European Network of Research Ethics Committees (EUREC), both partners in TechEthos. However, our main target group are researchers from industry and academics.</p>
<p><ins>Wenzel</ins>: Another interesting target group are citizens. Because these technologies are still relatively new, but will impact society at large, citizens become crucial stakeholders. Therefore, it’s important to communicate these new and emerging technologies to citizen groups and also incorporate their concerns, which we have done in TechEthos.</p>
<p><strong>You have chosen to focus on three technologies: climate engineering, neurotechnologies, and extended reality. Why have you selected these technology families in particular?</strong></p>
<p><ins>Eva</ins>: Our task during the first six months of the project was to select three technology families which raise ethical issues and have a high socioeconomic impact. Through a horizon scan we <a href=""https://www.techethos.eu/new-emerging-technologies-a-horizon-scan/"" target=""undefined"">identified 150 technologies</a> and narrowed them down to 3 with the involvement of 77 experts. Climate engineering, representing a branch of technologies from carbon dioxide removal to solar radiation management; digital extended reality, covering technologies related to the metaverse as well as natural language processing; and neurotechnologies, directly monitoring, assessing, and manipulating the brain’s function. During the development of this project, the emerging discussions on ChatGPT and the most recent UN conferences on climate change confirmed the relevance of TechEthos’ technology selection.</p>
<p><strong>What was the purpose of your TechEthos game?</strong></p>
<p>Wenzel: When engaging with citizens you need a low threshold activity that does not ask for too much knowledge or preparation. We created the <a href=""https://www.techethos.eu/the-techethos-game-ages-of-technology-impacts/"" target=""undefined"">TechEthos game</a> that puts the players in the position of a fictitious Citizen World Council. The citizens were presented with one technology and had to decide which they want to support or not. The power of this game is that it really stimulates discussion right from the first card. At the end, we engaged with 330 participants, of which one third represented vulnerable groups. The transcripts of the conversations were then coded for “<a href=""https://www.techethos.eu/multi-stakeholder-evolution-of-techethos-scenarios-on-ethical-issues-in-climate-engineering-digital-extended-reality-and-neurotechnologies/"" target=""undefined"">citizen values</a>”, which become important when addressing new emerging technologies, and which have been included in the guideline enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>What were some of the most striking concerns that key stakeholders had in devising these scenarios?</strong></p>
<p><ins>Eva</ins>: One striking concern from the expert engagement in scenarios was that “technological fixes” must be balanced with fair social reforms. Citizens especially highlighted the values “equity”, “reliability” and “sustainability” against a <a href=""https://www.techethos.eu/results-of-media-analysis/"" target=""undefined"">media</a> discourse that tends to utilise catchwords such as “cyborgs”, “green hydrogen” and “virtual reality”. Research ethics committees also emphasised the necessity of guidance documents for an ethics review based on pertinent principles. And it was also interesting to realise in the <a href=""https://www.techethos.eu/enhancing-legal-frameworks-national-international-level/"" target=""undefined"">policy consultation</a> that in the legal framing, the definitions for a legal treatment are sometimes very weak which makes implementation difficult.</p>
<p><strong>In an ideal world, how would you expect the future of emerging technologies to develop in the next 20 years?</strong></p>
<p><ins>Eva</ins>: First of all, we have to take care that technology serves humanity and not vice versa. This has to be done by the interplay of various stakeholders; while we are witnessing how industry is shaping and paving the way, we have to take care that we implement proper regulation. In the next two decades we may expect technology driven disruptions around the world and in an ideal world this will become a win-win-win situation for producers, users, and nature on global scale.</p>
<p><ins>Wenzel</ins>: I hope that reflexive innovation becomes the new normal, and that involving relevant stakeholders becomes a paradigm in the development process of technologies. In TechEthos we aim at <a href=""https://www.techethos.eu/resources/deliverables-policy-briefs/"" target=""undefined"">policy makers</a>, but in an ideal world, there is an open involvement of all types of stakeholders into the technology development process.</p>

<p>Sustainability meets technological progress. A focus on green skills may be amplified with the entrance of innovative, data-driven technologies. Technology may sometimes be viewed as the answer to the need for more sustainable processes, while green skills may provide the essential human touch necessary to ensure these advancements are effectively and ethically applied. But is this always the case? And is there a universally optimal balance between the two? Such questions are explored in the six different projects that follow.  <br><br>An overview of the latest selection of news about foresight projects and topics opens the issue.

For this collection we, the European Commission’s Competence Centre on Foresight, used a narrative inquiry method. Instead of asking opinions about the future, we asked participants to share a story about their desirable future, followed by a few questions about that story, in order to more fully comprehend their thinking. In this process we were guided by Voices That Count.  <br><br>In this article, we’ll take a look at <strong>the first 591 stories of people that participated so far</strong>, mostly from Greece and Slovenia, followed by Germany, Spain and Italy. Approximately half of them are students, and the other half mainly consists of employed people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
","<p><strong>What are the key insights we gain from people’s #OurFutures stories? </strong> <br>What are people's hopes, concerns and ideas for our future in Europe and beyond? We will highlight some of the most interesting findings. They shall inspire you to help build the future of Europe. You might be a curious individual, researcher, entrepreneur or policymaker: all contribute to shape the future.</p>
<p><strong>High hopes and high concerns for the future of our planet </strong><br>The overwhelming majority of the participants are hopeful and inspired by the future images they shared, and positive feelings are mostly associated to stories about nature, fairness and well-being. Interestingly enough, these topics are also leading the minority of less positive stories. <br><br>More than 40% of the participants talk about climate and nature issues. They imagine greener cities and a circular economy, show attention to the need to preserve biodiversity, to pursue more sustainable mobility etc. When people talk about caring for each other or health issues, they very often give it an environmental flavour: our health depends on the health of planet Earth and the need to protect it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Seventeen years from now, I would like the world to be […] a place where everything is in balance, especially the climate. Seventeen years from now I would like to see diesel or petrol cars abolished, factory emissions reduced and nature and greenery allowed to enter cities more efficiently. I would like the pavements to be cultivated, so as to support 0-impact mobility, and I would also like all houses to have an A grade or higher, so as to preserve the environment.” </em></p>
<p>Participants do not believe that their future will happen by itself. It will take strengthening human connections, relationships, communication and empathy. In addition, the need for a stronger connection with nature and with the local context emerge from the stories. <br><br>Even though their images are mostly positive, respondents are quite concerned about the future. They show a rather pessimistic view of our ability to tackle climate-related and other environmental challenges: often the future they describe is seen as only possible in a utopian world. They especially express concern, powerlessness and fear when their stories are less about the future and more about a depiction of our current times.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“The golden age is over. With inevitable climate change a centuries long age of decline has begun.” ”There is essentially no hope for our future on this planet.” </em></p>
<p>Generally, though, the younger generation shares optimistic stories about the environment and the future of the planet, and believe that their perception will happen. Their images talk about de-growth, sustainable lifestyles, less individualism and more attention to the relationships among communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“One of the most important changes I would like to see in the future has to do with our energy consumption and production. It is vital that we switch to renewable sources of energy soon, as it is severely harmful to the environment.”  </em></p>
<p>However, they seem to believe less in their own ability to shape that future in comparison to other age groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social issues: what is included and what is absent in the stories?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social dimensions are very much present in the images of the respondents - especially in those shared by women. Many stories mention a strong wish for a world without any discrimination based on gender, colour, and sexual orientation, and a fair Europe in which everyone has access to the same opportunities regardless of their background.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“I wish that minorities will no longer be singled out, but that it will become normal for them to have respectable positions in society.” </em></p>
<p>The strong focus on zero discrimination, social justice and solidarity, is also present in the few future images related to migration. Only 6% of the people connect their story to ‘migration’, and in those few stories that do talk about refugees, the topic is generally taken up from a positive stand: a plea for open borders, the need to care for migrants, and the wish to fully include them in the socio-economic space.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“In my vision of an ideal 2040, freedom of movement should be open to all - not a headache for those who need to flee or a utopia for those who cannot afford it.” </em></p>
<p><em>“Climate refugees will be welcomed and integrated in the villages and co-living projects.”  </em></p>
<p>An overall desire for more economic well-being for everyone is common in stories related to the economy, and ‘work’ doesn’t seem to be top of mind when thinking about the future: very few people (only 8%) tagged their stories as related to ‘work/occupation’. This might also have to do with the fact that financially insecure, unemployed (and retired) people are at the moment underrepresented in this exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Politicians, business people and citizens together can make a better future happen – but citizens see themselves acting first </strong><br>The future is shaped by today’s actions. But who are the people that need to act to realise these desirable futures?  <br><br>The majority of contributors feel that government leaders, business people, scientists and citizens will need to work together to make the change happen. A clear trend, however, shows how important citizens or citizen groups are as changemakers. This pattern remains the same no matter what age group. Consequently, people feel that their own role in creating their future is quite substantial. Especially people that connect a positive feeling to their story believe in their ability to co-create their imagined future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Surrounded with a community of people who have positive attitude to make the society better. Be a conscious global citizen and sustainable life style (SDGS#12), intergenerational community, less spiritual-material divide, simple life style” </em></p>
<p><strong>Strong belief in technology and science </strong><br>For people that are confident about the achievability of their future, technology plays a crucial role. Science and technology will help to find solutions to the major challenges of our world: it will enable economic well-being and high-quality life for everyone while protecting the environment. It will solve current challenges or strengthen new pathways in different sectors (communication, transport, employment, medicine, etc.). <br><br>Technology enjoys a very positive and optimistic flavour, especially when it comes to healthcare (Covid-19 was still very much present at the start of the story collection): it can enable more advanced surgeries and treatments for incurable diseases, further increasing life expectancy. <br><br>Reading the stories in which ‘business people &amp; scientists’ were seen as crucial to making that future happen, digitisation at all levels is the top topic. There seems to be a big hope in a high-tech future, ranging from technologies that attempt to divert climate change to the complete digitisation of our society, in which robots replace almost everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“I see a future where people live in two domains, the physical and the metaverse. The metaverse will have much more relevance in the future. In some occasions, it will have prevalence regarding the physical world. The interplay between AI, Virtual Reality, Metaverse, Augmented reality will bring a new dimension in human life, even in longevity. Regarding the longevity, some of us will life as an avatar in a metaverse enabled by several companies that provide that service.” </em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some other stories describe how technology will affect daily life.</p>
<p><em>“Superfast internet will make it possible to visit other countries staying at home in virtual reality.”  </em></p>
<p><em>“With the development of technology, many things have changed in our lives. People are now lazier because of this. They are lazier to do things and this affects the life of the whole world.”</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increased presence of technology in our lives is seen as a negative evolution only in a few stories. Single cases describe how applications might take control over our societies and evolve towards a totalitarian state.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The relevance of local communities</strong> <br>The majority of respondents (more than 60%) consider their future images influenced by worldwide challenges, while European issues play a role in every sixth contribution. This corresponds with the high focus on climate change and global justice reflected in the stories, and, as the word ‘war’ is present in 49 stories, undoubtedly the war in Ukraine also influenced people's future thinking.  <br><br>National and local challenges each are considered to influence the future image only in every tenth story; however, community action at the local level is seen as the key driver to actively shape the future in nearly one third of the stories.   <br><br>Contributors see a significant role for themselves in strengthening human connections, creating better relationships in their neighbourhoods, or call for more empathy towards those who are seen as ‘different’ (in terms of ethnic background, gender, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“I would like to see as many people as possible volunteering to help individuals in their community. E.g. helping the elderly and the disabled with grocery deliveries, transport. Helping children to learn, volunteering in schools to help with sports and other activities organised by the school, etc.”  </em></p>
<p>A closer connection with nature is also reflected in local stories: from the need to change personal behaviours, to changes surroundings as through urban planning. <br><br>A small but still substantial number of stories talks about young people’s very personal concerns related to housing, finding a job, and having a pension.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“It's no secret that the younger generation has been dealt a tough hand.”  </em></p>
<p><em>“In the future, I would like everyone to be able to live in as little deprivation as possible; or for young people to be able to live as normally as possible; or to make the transition from adolescence to adulthood without major deprivation. By this I mean, above all, making it easier to become independent or to start life on one's own, where the housing would be reasonably priced or the rent would not be too high, and would enable the individual to live more easily and save money.” </em></p>
<p><strong>General concern without losing hope? </strong><br>Although 70% of the people associate the image of their future with only positive feelings, people are clearly concerned about the future: 50% of the respondents have indicated high levels of concern.  <br><br>Still, their concern is not hopeless: a lot seems to be possible at local level if people act together, with technology as an ally.  <br><br>In the perspective offered by the stories collected, the challenge for decision makers and for policy makers becomes to enable a collaborative exchange among businesses, policymakers and citizens. Their combined efforts are in fact crucial to enable the overwhelming majority of positive societal and environmental scenarios shared in this exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

","<p>We humans are creatures made of words, just as we are made of atoms. Within any language, metaphors are essential instruments of thought, shaping how we perceive, conceptualize and act in the world. As more complex tapestries, stories have always been fundamental to the human experience, helping us understand the world, connect with others, navigate our emotions, preserve our heritage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foresight, and more generally futures thinking, is no stranger to these sense-making devices. They are integral to crafting rich, imaginative, and plausible scenarios, or articulating visions and preferred futures and the pathways to achieve them. Also, they are crucial in communicating foresight findings and driving meaningful action towards shaping the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are five articles I recommend, very different in their angle and scope, on issues related to present and future metaphors, use of data, stories, narratives, imaginaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The themes in these articles resonate, to different extents, with recent foresight projects or future oriented initiatives showcased on futures4europe, which I also invite you to explore. They are linked, under each article, for your convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

","<p>In the ream of intellectual property (IP), where patents protect inventions, trademarks guard brand identities, and copyrights secure original works, copyrights are especially challenged by digital advancements and generative AI applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Caterina Sganga, Comparative Private Law professor at Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna (Pisa) and coordinator of the reCreating Europe project, finding a happy fit between AI regulation and intellectual property rights is one of the greatest challenges ahead in innovation management.  Sganga observes how AI is quite tricky to regulate because it requires a deep re-elaboration of the notion of creativity based on human expression. To foster innovation, a review of the current copyright regulation must not only consider AI-generated content but also strike a balance between recognising authorship in human-originated creativity and  incentivising AI producers in advancing machine-based generative potentials. The latter also entails an assessment of the impact of text and data mining copyright exceptions on Europe's AI industry competitiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reCreating Europe project sought to rethink copyright law through the removal of regulatory uncertainty, paving the way to a culturally diverse, accessible, and creative Europe. The project’s three-year research has shown how AI is not the only undetermined area in copyright legislation. European countries face legal uncertainty regarding the use of derived creativity (online and offline), cross-border content use, and cultural heritage preservation. This is the legacy of a 'territorial’ approach to copyright that linked its regulation to national branding and domestic protectionism. In a digitally connected world, copyright laws should be modernised from a Pan-European perspective.</p>
<p>“Overcoming the current patchwork of norms and developing a fully harmonised copyright law across the EU, is paramount for Europe to be united in diversity”, Sganga considers. Although some aspects have already been harmonised through the introduction of mandatory rules to be implemented by all member states, Sganga believes copyright must be further raised to the European level: “This might expose copyright to higher lobbying pressures but will ultimately enjoy the benefits of cross-institutional balancing mechanisms and attention to freedom of expression”. The EC’s direct input, through the issuing of guidelines about the interpretation and handling of IP, would also be an asset to reach regulatory harmony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harmonisation must not translate into one-size-fits-all approaches. A blanket solution for IP regulation can be detrimental to the creative industry. Sganga recommends a two-level intervention, developing both a general IP code and sector-specific regulations, taking into account the diverse needs in copyright protection for sectors like literature and music. As positively exemplified by the co-regulatory approach shaping the AI Act,  Sganga advocates for interdepartmental co-regulation and the involvement of all copyright stakeholders in the development of a unitary title for copyright, currently the only major IP right lacking uniformity across the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among reCreating Europe’s final outputs is a set of ‘digestible’ <a href=""https://recreating.eu/activities-resources/policy-recommendations-guidelines-best-practices/"" target=""undefined"">policy recommendations</a> tailored to the multiple stakeholders concerned with copyright regulation, such as users/consumers, authors/performers, creative industries, GLAMs, and intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sganga suggests aligning copyright regulation with EU cultural policies and Open Science policies to account for their interplays in a holistic fashion. Compatibility with cultural policies implies adapting copyright law and its balancing tools to enable everyone to participate in their community's cultural life. This includes fostering cultural diversity by supporting niche cultural and creative expressions. From an Open Science perspective, copyright alignment would entail balancing exclusivity and access to scientific publications via, for example, the introduction of secondary publishing rights for authors and broader research exceptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flexibility in copyright law is crucial for innovation, particularly in secondary creativity products not covered by existing exceptions which do not compete with original works and are often used freely in the US. Sganga highlights the importance of managing transformative uses of creative content to support democratic access to culture and participation in cultural life within an everyday digital environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, broadening our understanding of diversity and inclusivity, especially for people with disabilities, is necessary to offer equal cultural access. Sganga notes recent improvements in copyright exceptions for disabilities but points out gaps, especially for cognitive and learning impairments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market power in the creative industry, and the dominance of platform-based distribution models, threaten content diversity. Increased centalisation on the distribution side, following profit markets and converging towards mainstream repertoires and forms of expression may disadvantage smaller creators through recommendation algorithms, limiting the variety of cultural and creative products. This reduction can negatively impact public debate, education and societal evolution through critical thinking. “Public discourse is based on  cultural and creative products and how we critically engage with them”, warns Sganga. “A reduced selection of cultural products disempowers societies to evolve through critical thinking”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To counter intellectual poverty, collective copyright management must fairly represent creators, ensuring fair compensation and rights negotiation. Part of this empowerment includes the provision of tools allowing individual artists and small producers to be the main beneficiaries of the value of their creations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Sganga emphasises the environmental impact of production innovation and consumption patterns, advocating for a flexible approach to copyright law that discourages multiplication by promoting transformative use, reuse, and re-creation of original works for environmental sustainability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>True to its name, ReCreating Europe advocates a multi-stakeholder re-negotiation of legislative frameworks to bring Europe under a unitary copyright title sufficiently flexible to safeguard content diversity and recognise sectorial specificity, yet rigid enough to make creative innovation accountable for sustainability.</p>

The project is conducted by the “Foresight on Demand” Consortium on behalf of the European Commission, DG RTD. In a Deep Dive area “Climate change and R&amp;I: from social change to geoengineering”, together with the other members of the expert team, I am developing, among others, this 'deepening divisions' scenario.<br><br>Get involved, comment on the scenario and relate the scenario to recent developments!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
","<p><strong>Scenario dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Weak global governance; Unsustainable lifestyles; Open to risk-taking; Vigorous activism<br><br><strong>Demographics, economy and governance</strong></p>
<p>In 2040 Europe stands divided. Populist, <strong>secessionist governments</strong> are in power in Poland, Italy and France (amongst others). <strong>European institutions struggle</strong> to exercise power and influence. In the wider world relations with Russia remain uneasy following the division of Ukraine; China-US military clashes continue in the South China Sea as China accuses the US of funding and arming Tibetan separatists, and tensions escalate between the EU and the Pan-African Confederation over the continued death-toll amongst climate migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean. Global climate governance is just one of the many casualties.</p>
<p>In this world <strong>nationalist competition over resources</strong> dominates international relations, and free trade is a long-lost dream. European economies continue to falter as supply chains further fragment. Populist movements verging on fascism are in the ascendance in dozens of countries, while <strong>local territorial defence and independence movements have become violent</strong> in several cases. <strong>Populations are divided and polarised</strong>, with <strong>consumption unabated</strong>. Wealthy elites retreat into secure compounds and gated communities. And while some environmental activists are trying to build resilient self-sufficient eco-villages, others have embraced <strong>violence,</strong> especially in the face of authoritarian policing of protest and attacks on political freedoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Real and imagined threats of climate migrants and refugees from Africa continue to dominate political discourse. In every country border controls are strengthened. Walls, fences and deportation programs proliferate. The Mediterranean and its coasts are more like a war zone than a holiday destination, with naval forces and drones deployed to deter crossings. But political myopia and <strong>nationalism infect climate policy</strong> – with more focus on <strong>local, exclusionary adaptation</strong> than mitigation. Populist movements combine ethno-nationalist prejudice with continued support for <strong>fossil fuel use</strong> – rhetorically described as <strong>cheap and patriotic</strong>. <br><br><strong>Impacts and risk areas</strong></p>
<p>Climate change is both a trigger and a consequence of fragmentation and deepening divisions. While biodiversity losses multiply as temperature rises reach 1.7oC, climate scientists project temperatures rising further, <strong>beyond 3oC</strong> above pre-industrial levels. Impacts are already widely felt, not only in coastal communities and those affected by vanishing glaciers and melting permafrost, but more widely and especially in the form of prolonged heatwaves, massive wildfires and droughts during summers followed by autumn flooding. These conditions have <strong>devastated agricultural production</strong> and exacerbated pressures on electricity systems: droughts causing nuclear shutdowns due to lack of cooling water, whilst demands for energy rise with widespread use of air-conditioning. Energy and food prices have spiralled, fuelling <strong>food and energy poverty</strong>; undermining livelihoods, harming health and wellbeing for many, and fragmenting communities.</p>
<p>Rising prices have also fuelled <strong>populist anti-EU and anti-climate </strong>action sentiment. Public sentiment, powered by populist media is further <strong>polarised</strong> by more <strong>radical climate activism </strong>using cyberattacks, blockades and violence against property to attack fossil power stations, airports and other targets (including geoengineering research facilities). Most states deploy anti-terror powers against climate activists, and <strong>paramilitary responses</strong> (tacitly ignored by state authorities) including assassination and kidnapping of activists have spread from the extractive frontiers of the global South to some European countries.<br><br><strong>Practices and technologies</strong></p>
<p>Scientists and technologists have demonstrated most of the suite of new climate technologies anticipated in 2020, including new-generation nuclear fission, carbon capture and storage (CCS), green and blue hydrogen and ammonia production, CCS has been linked not only to industrial processes but also to bioenergy (BECCS) and capture of CO2 direct from the atmosphere (DACCS). But none of these technologies have reached scale as <strong>supply chains, social licence, and investment flows have all been disrupted</strong> and undermined by international and national conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, scientists are now widely and urgently advocating and researching more radical and controversial technological approaches including <strong>ocean fertilisation</strong> for carbon removal, and large-scale <strong>albedo modification</strong> through GM crops, <strong>stratospheric aerosol injection or space mirrors</strong>. Trials of some of these technologies have attracted <strong>billionaire philanthropy eager to scale up their application</strong>. In parallel, suspicions and conspiracy theories abound on social media, multiplied by hostile state disinformation, to the effect that the droughts and floods are in fact a product of such ‘greenfinger’ geoengineering (rather than the reason for such experiments). <br><br><strong>Life-styles and activism</strong></p>
<p>For the wealthy, lifestyles remain luxurious, and most citizens aspire to enjoy such high levels of consumption and mobility. Products with green and ‘sustainable’ labels are scarce and expensive, even though widely considered to be mainly <strong>greenwash</strong>. In our divided society though, anti-consumerist riots and looting, involving destruction of merchandise or property are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Climate activism takes multiple forms. For some,<strong> climate grief</strong> is expressed through embrace of religious faiths, and some engage in non-violent protest such as hunger strikes. Conventional NGOs continue to lack influence in polarised political debates, and more radical forms of activism have proliferated including demonstrations and mass arrests, hacktivism and cyber-attacks, and even <strong>eco-terrorism</strong>, sabotage and bombing</p>

","<p>We have seen ‘Big’ before. Big Finance, Big Oil,  Big Media, and Big Pharma are all about market  dominance in the hands of a few private  companies. If it is not a new feature of capitalism,  why has Big Tech, today’s XL player, made it onto the Horizon Futures Watch list? Digital giants  seem to cast a longer (and darker) shadow.  Slipping through market regulations, Big Tech has invaded the public sphere and is threatening not only free markets but also the democratic process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Big Tech name-dropping will give the  density of ‘Modern Bigness’ away: Amazon, Apple,  Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Meta  (Facebook). These top 5 tech giants are digital  sprawlers: their empires ‘rule’ many aspects of our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This supremacy does not stop at market power and political lobbying. Big Tech’s delivery and control of the  digital arena has generated a subtle but mighty force: digital power. The effects of this elusive power escape  market relationships and are thus harder to trace, assess, and hold accountable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Utrecht University’s School of Law, the EU-funded <a href=""https://www.uu.nl/en/research/modern-bigness"" target=""undefined"">MOBI</a> project (ERC grant) is exploring ‘Modern Bigness’  from a normative point of view. Led by Anna Gerbrandy, MOBI project coordinator and Professor of  Competition Law, PhD and postdoc students are researching the composite power that defines ‘Modern Bigness’ and its implications for antitrust regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gerbrandy puts a finger on the struggle to regulate Big Tech by highlighting how “competition law currently  deals with fair market competition, market shares, and consumer rights. However, the non-market effects  impacting the public domain, where digital power turns into public power and perhaps threatens democratic  relationships, are formally beyond the discipline’s reach”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wider perspective is required to overcome the legislative impasse caused by gaps in the legal system and  respond with normative instruments. “It’s not good enough to focus on market power” – Gerbrandy explains – “Big Tech can influence the right to reliable information (jeopardised by biased newsfeeds), impact free speech  (polluted by social media-induced polarisation of public discourse), fair political representation (threatened by  electoral algorithms) and privacy (endangered by exposure of sensitive data)”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With aggressive business models, gobbling up start-ups and SMEs, platforming services, and aggregating  data, Big Tech gurus are now unrivalled ‘gatekeepers’. “Google is our access point to the Internet, Facebook has become a news editor and Amazon has turned into the ‘everything store’”, observes Gerbrandy. Big Tech has penetrated the core of public institutions and governing bodies making them reliant on private digital infrastructure for their operations and blurring the boundaries between consumers and citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As digitalisation and platform-based services are branching out into key sectors such as healthcare  (telemedicine and AI diagnostics), agri-food (environmental monitoring and supply chain management),  education (virtual learning), and transportation (automation), Big Tech will likely be involved in the delivery of  most public services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MOBI’s research highlights how the legal modus operandi must stretch beyond its comfort zone to ‘tame’ Big  Tech and keep up to speed with the social challenges posed by rapid technological progress. The values of  Source: Freepic the open society are at risk if the concept of ‘power’ is not extended beyond monitoring mergers and  acquisitions. According to Van Dijck (1), “Institutional innovation should become just as sexy as technological  innovation”. European competition law is already adapting to counterbalance ‘Modern Bigness’ by keeping  companies accountable for their market effects (i.e., through lawsuits and fines for unfair competition, use of  sensitive data, misleading news, etc.). A quicker pace of change is crucial to anticipate power scenarios and  include holistic power checks in the regulation of Big Tech sooner rather than later, at greater costs and efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future-thinking helps us identify worst-case scenarios if we fail to strike the power balance. “Taking it to an  extreme, we could face a technocracy” – warns Gerbrandy – “in which public institutions (government  agencies, courts, schools, healthcare facilities, etc.) become so dependent on privately owned digital  infrastructures to deliver their services that decision-making is outsourced to Big Tech-controlled algorithms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gerbrandy points to the billionaires’ “space race” to help frame issues of resource ownership and control of  services. Space cowboys such as Musk (SpaceX) and Bezos (Blue Origin) are planting satellites and providing  rockets to explore the galaxy. Although space colonisation might be a wise Plan B if life on Earth was at risk,  Gerbrandy wonders: “Is it desirable to have private companies control access to space and its future  colonisation, or should we support government space agencies?”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is uncertainty as to what the dangers of overregulating or underregulating Big Tech are, but Gerbrandy  has no doubt about protecting the public sphere, always. “If strengthening the public domain means delivering  heavier regulations on Big Tech or breaking up large companies”, she notes, “we have to consider the option”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Europe has moved faster than other governments with the issuing of the <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package"" target=""undefined"">Digital Services Act Package</a> including the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the <a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence"" target=""undefined"">AI Act</a> which aim to create a humancentric, safe, and fair digital space for users and businesses. “Tech Gurus may need time to adapt to the new  regulations, but we are heading in the right direction”, comments Gerbrandy.</p>

International law identifies four global commons, namely the High Seas, the Atmosphere, the Antarctica and the Outer Space. These resource domains are guided by the principle of the common heritage of mankind. Resources of interest or value to the welfare of the community of nations – such as tropical rain forests and biodiversity - have lately been included among the traditional set of global commons as well, while some define the global commons even more broadly, including science, education, information and peace. To incorporate the potential for overuse by some at the expense of others, they can also include the <a href=""https://post.parliament.uk/environmental-stewardship-of-the-global-commons/"" target=""_blank"">atmosphere, land, ocean, ice sheets, a stable climate and biodiversity</a>.&nbsp;</p>
","<p>According to the Global Commons Alliance, there are currently two definitions of the global commons: One is based in geopolitics. In this definition the global commons are areas – and their potential economic resources – that lie beyond national jurisdiction: the atmosphere, the high seas, Antarctica and outer space. The second definition has its roots more in economics than geopolitics and relates to how shared resources can be overused by some at the expense of others, regardless of national jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the main characteristics of global commons is that they have a value for humankind and the planet. In some cases they even play a crucial role in the survival of our species. More recently, cyberspace has also been regarded as meeting the definition of a global common. (Luk van Langenhove)</p>
<p>The global commons, comprising the areas and resources beyond the sovereigny of any state, build upon the heritage of Grotius’s idea of mare liberum – an idea that aimed to preserve the freedom of access for the benefit of all (3). However, the old mare liberum idea digressed into ‘first come, first served’ advantages for industrialised countries. Especially at the initiative of developing countries, it has now been replaced by a new law of international cooperation and protection of natural wealth and resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.</p>
<p>According to Vogler, global commons can be considered as “social constructs that overlay, interpret and allocate ‘brute’ physical facts such as the gravitational forces in space, marine organisms, or deep seabed features that exist independently of our observation (Searle, 1995). The designation of areas and resources as global commons is evidently related both to technological change and scarcity, and both have combined to shape current definitions of the commons problem. ….the list of candidates for global commons status continues to grow. Cyberspace or the ‘digital ecosystem’, intellectual property and crop genetic resources are all so described with attendant implications for governance and security. The defining characteristic of commons relates to the question of access. One shared characteristic of the global commons is their close association with scientific discovery and developing technological capability (mare liberum 1609, Antarctica 1958, outer space from 1957).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been substantial recent interest in the global commons amongst the military and strategic studies communities (Jasper, 2010). Their paramount concern is, as ever, the maintenance of access to strategically significant parts of the global commons. Access is also at the heart of environmental framing of the commons, but here it is the consequences of an open access regime and associated tragedies of resource degradation, depletion or destruction that are usually highlighted.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Towards a Taxonomy of Commons</strong></p>
<p>Drawing on the <a href=""https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315086415/global-commons-susan-buck"" target=""_blank"">work of Susan Buck</a>, this paper outlines a draft taxonomy of commons, distinguishing between local, international and global commons as well as common pool resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Susan Buck, commons are resource domains in which common pool resources are found.</p>
<p><em>“</em><strong><em>Common pool resources</em></strong><em> are subtractable resources managed under a property regime in which a legally defined user pool cannot be efficiently excluded from the resource domain. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>International commons or global commons</em></strong><em> are very large resource domains that do not fall within the jurisdiction of any one country.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>International commons </em></strong><em>are resource domains shared by several nations, such as the Mediterranean Sea and Antarctica (although recent United Nations environmental treaties have affected the Antarctic regime so that it has some of the characteristics of a global commons). </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Global commons</em></strong><em> are resource domains to which all nations have legal access, such as outer space. The distinction between the two is important, especially because international commons are exclusionary while global commons are not. “</em> (Buck)</p>

This mirrors the growing interest and demand for foresight that is also reinforced by the United Nations reform agenda and the Secretary-General’s report on ‘Our Common Agenda’, which calls for all UN agencies, as well as all UN member states, to engage foresight practices more deeply and apply the derived insights to address global systemic risks. This process has culminated in the development of the present report “Navigating New Horizons – A Global Foresight Report on Planetary Health and Human Wellbeing”, produced by UNEP in collaboration with the International Science Council. The report calls for the world to pay heed and respond to a range of emerging challenges that could disrupt planetary health and wellbeing. It presents insights on eight critical global shifts that are accelerating the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity and nature loss and pollution and waste. Eighteen signals of change – identified by hundreds of global experts and distilled through regional and stakeholder consultations that included youth – offer a glimpse into potential disruptions, both positive and negative, that the world needs to keep a watching brief on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report outlines how to create an enabling environment for better decision-making by creating a new social contract, embracing agile and adaptive governance, and increasing integrated accessible data and knowledge. The report offers a stark reminder of the interconnectedness and fragility of our systems in the 21st Century and warns that prioritizing short-term gains over anticipatory action and preparedness jeopardizes long-term prosperity and planetary health. However, it also points to the tremendous potential and human ingenuity that can be leveraged in the spirit of discovery and cooperation to deliver solutions across the triple crisis. The outcomes of the report will be integrated into UNEP’s strategic planning, potentially influencing the next UNEP Medium-Term Strategy, presenting an opportunity to consider expanding programmes in areas like artificial intelligence, new technology, and robotics in agriculture, prompting discussions on the level of engagement in these issues. This will ultimately serve UNEP in adopting a proactive posture and modernize tools for efficiency and cost savings.</p>

<p>Over the course of the two-day workshop, the participants explored the theme of emotion ecosystems by working through a structured process in three facilitated groups, whose composition shifted at key moments. The work began by framing the concept of “emotion ecosystems” in terms of a <strong>curated set of societal tensions</strong>, each expressing the strain between a shared aspiration and its undesirable consequences: 🌀 Hyperconnection vs Isolation; 🌍Craving for unity vs Tribal polarization; 🩹 Healing collective traumas vs Solitary coping ...and more.<br><br>To delve into these tensions, participants applied the <strong>Causal Layered Analysis</strong> (CLA) framework twice: first, 🔍to examine the present by unpacking common narratives, systemic structures, shared worldviews, and deep cultural metaphors; and then again, in a creative key, 💡to imagine preferable futures. This second phase involved reconstructing alternative metaphors, beliefs, and systemic designs, supported by a short horizon scanning exercise based on a set of pre-existing and participant-generated key drivers of change.&nbsp;</p>

","<p>The concept of the global commons refers to resource domains that fall outside national jurisdiction, to which all have access, including high seas, airspace, outer space, and cyberspace. Given the growing significance of these domains and related resources for states and other global and local players across a range of purposes, defining the concept of the global commons has become more complex. The Global Commons Alliance network of concerned organisations refers to two definitions of the concept.</p>
<p><br>The first is based on geopolitics, where the global commons are areas whose potential economic resources lie beyond national jurisdiction: the atmosphere, the high seas, Antarctica, and outer space. The second definition has its roots more in economics and how shared resources can be overused by some at the expense of others, regardless of national jurisdiction. The strategic access and use of resource domains for military/commercial purposes put pressure on their status. Recent geopolitical developments highlight the need for exploring appropriate forms of global governance or stewardship to ensure responsible (sustainable) management to benefit present and future generations.</p>
<p>This deep dive aims to address the following questions:<br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What constitutes a global commons?</strong> How do global commons differ? How is the concept of global commons likely to evolve up to 2040? Adapting a taxonomy of global commons for the emerging geopolitical, environmental, and economic context.</li>
<li><strong>What are the main emerging disruptors of global commons up to 2040?</strong> What could change and upset established global commons regimes? How can laws be introduced and implemented in emerging global commons? The emphasis is on geopolitics and how legal frameworks can survive technological change. How can innovation reinforce the commons?</li>
<li><strong>How is the economics of common property evolving </strong>(from Hardin's very influential work to the massive critique of Hardin by Elinor Ostrom)? linking to major policy debates such as privatisation. Can Ostrom’s approach be scaled up to the level of states? and extended to the common property of the atmosphere or oceans? What would be necessary for such a large-scale negotiation process?</li>
<li><strong>How can we govern the commons as a different type of ownership?</strong> The emergence of global commons-orientation in innovation? In particular mission-oriented innovation. Exploring the rights and personality of ecosystems and other entities as right holders. Ecological services as transversal.</li>
<li><strong>How can we make the global commons work?</strong> - the need for cooperative behaviour if global commons and sustainability are to be achieved. Multilateralism 2.0. and emerging role of science diplomacy up to 2040.  Ukraine war as an epochal war: the dangers of the war (state of permanent cold war) for acting seriously on the global commons. Potential split with China and new hegemonies in Africa (e.g Belt and Road debt).<br><br><br>The aim is to identify cross impacts of the global commons areas and key drivers.</li>

The desire to stay healthy and to have a long-lasting life is enormous. At first glance, it seems as if the increasing number of older people in the EU is in accordance with that. When having a closer look at that trend, three main factors seem to contribute to an overall older population: a generally increased life expectancy, a modern, readily accessible medical system, healthier lifestyles, and low birth rates. Migration is a counter-trend to the ageing society, as the majority of migrants to the EU are young families. This fact, however, does not substantially diminish the absolute number of older people in the EU. The potential consequences are diverse. Although people get older while being healthier, it is likely that the cost of health care will rise, putting an extra burden on the health insurance system. Hence, we might have to expect a clear social divide: Will only rich people be able to afford to get old? Or are the additional health-related costs going to be shifted to younger generations? Will the state have to step in? </p>","<p>Such a development might be fostered by the increased cost of health treatment itself. High-tech medicine requires high investments by hospitals. At the same time, the ongoing trend of economisation and commercialisation of the health care system elevates the pressure to be profitable. A continuous growth in health-related costs is the result. Unsurprisingly, not all patients will be able to cover those expenses. What now? Will there be a multi-class health care system in the EU? Do we have to give more power and ownership to the state? This would be a reversal of the currently predominant privatisation practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our modern times, so-called biohacking is growing in popularity. Biohacking is a form of self-optimisation based on making lifestyle changes, using nutritional supplements and undergoing certain medical treatments, with fresh-cell therapy being one of them. All those means require access to wealth, which strongly correlates with education. On a basic level, leading a healthy lifestyle is easily applicable. Methods of high-tech-optimisation, in contrast, are only accessible to wealthier members of society.</p>
<p>In the context of an ageing society, we find a public debate on postponing the retirement age. It is to be expected that older people will be healthier and therefore able to contribute more to the pension and health care system for a longer period of time. This potentially will provoke a debate on equity and justice. In the light of the above-mentioned social divide caused by economic welfare, this felt injustice might foster the social divide.</p>
<p>Europe is quite heterogeneous in terms of social inclusion. While in several countries older people mainly live in retirement homes, in other countries it is somewhat normal for them to be taken care of by their families. Older people are less open to novelties in digitalisation regardless of those living circumstances. There is a growing discrepancy between an increasing number of older people not being reached by recent digital innovations and the advance of fully digitalised procedures into numerous aspects of everyday life. This development has a double effect: first, the market for new digital solutions is limited. Secondly, older people progressively get disconnected or at least overwhelmed by digital modernisations. This causes quite a lot of them to reject digital means altogether, which then reinforces their marginalisation even stronger.</p>
<p>A possible side effect of this digital marginalisation is the loss of trust in health guidance, leading to lower recovery rates from illness. From an evolutionary perspective, one could argue that, despite the potential of people getting older, the unbalanced access to modern means of health care will counteract the ageing of our society. This raises the question of what ethical standards to apply. Do we want a Europe that has economised ethics? There might be an increasing tension between social inclusion and the digital, as well as the economic divide between the young and the old. Digitalisation and privatisation are likely to add to the marginalisation of a growing group of European citizens and, therefore, the fragmentation of society.</p>
<p>Hence, a central question must be how to make an ageing population keep up with a vast and fast societal modernisation. How do you want to get old? Would it be enough that Research and Innovation care for the needs of an ageing society? What about digitalisation's indirect effects on an ageing society in all aspects of life?</p>
<p><strong>A note to the article</strong></p>
<p>This small article is derived from a Qualitative Model which has been build on the basis of the <a href=""https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-law-and-publications/publication-detail/-/publication/3c6ffd74-8ac3-11eb-b85c-01aa75ed71a1"" target=""_blank"">Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021 -2024</a> .&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the topic ageing society is not new and many studies and knowledge exist, it is remarkable that a topic like an ageing society has cross connections across the whole Strategic Plan. Not always, this has been obvious. What do you think? Is this aspect of demographic change adequately reflected in today's R&amp;I policy?</p>
<p><strong>Look into the model</strong></p>
<p>Access this <a href=""https://www.imodeler.info/ro?key=CsKuXczPWB6lOcN2FJxjhZg"" target=""_blank"">link</a> to navigate through the model. The model is rather complex, and you might easily lose the overview. Please check the ""iMODELERCheatSheet"" if you don't know how to navigate any more.</p>
","<p>Short description of the model</p>
<p>This model represents the logic of argumentation and the underlying assumptions of the <a href=""https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-law-and-publications/publication-detail/-/publication/3c6ffd74-8ac3-11eb-b85c-01aa75ed71a1"" target=""_blank"">Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021 -2024</a>.</p>
<p>The Model is both built upon the 6 Thematic Clusters and the KSOs. Central for this kind of assessment are the “Expected Impacts” that have been compiled by the European Commission and the Member Countries. These Expected Impacts are ""collected"" by the clusters on one hand and on the other hand-tied to the so-called ""Impact Areas"" that are connected to the KSOs.</p>
<p>Hence, the Model can be assessed towards the Clusters or the KSOs. The model is large and strongly interconnected. Therefore, a good first step is to access the model based on the presenter, in which you can find preselected views and assessments of the model.</p>
<p>The presenter-mode in the Model is targeted towards the above-shown article</p>

THE CHANGING WORLD: impacts in Portugal – brief introduction"" (2024, RePLAN multisectoral team) (Portuguese version only)</p>
<p>This  digital brochure, recently published on March 2024, is a publication by the Planning and Foresight Services Network of the Public Administration (PlanAPP), as part of the activities carried out by the Multisectoral Foresight Team of the Portuguese Network of Public Administration Planning and Foresight Services (RePLAN). This brochure is a brief introduction to the 2050 Megatrends Report for Portugal, to be published by the end of 2024. Both publications are coordinated by the Planning and Foresight Services Network of the Public Administration (<a href=""https://www.planapp.gov.pt/"" target=""undefined"">PlanAPP</a>), as part of the activities carried out by the Multisectoral Foresight Team of the Portuguese Network of Public Administration Planning and Foresight Services (RePLAN). The brochure presents, in a very brief and preliminary way, the nine global megatrends that are likely to shape the future of Portugal, with a general description and a list of the most relevant potential impacts: Worsening climate change; Growing pressure on natural resources; Diversifying and changing economic models; Diverging demographic trends; A more urban world; A more digital world; Accelerating technological development; A multipolar world and New challenges to democracy.</p>
<p>The identification and description of megatrends for Portugal is a work in progress, based on a collaborative, systematic and open process. During 2024, with the aim of producing a report and supporting the formulation of public policies, this process will be deepened with workshops, expert consultation, and citizen participation. To support the discussion of the megatrends in a multisectorial approach, a series of workshops/webinars were planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop RePLAN: Megatrends for Portugal from the prospective of security and defense (26 – 27 March 2024) was organized by the Portuguese Institute of National Defense and included a discussion about all identified megatrends and its relation to the security and defense sectors.</li>
<li>Workshop RePLAN: Megatrends with impact for Portugal from the prospective of Territory-Sea-Environment (10th may 2024) This workshop is being organized by the Directorate-General for Sea Policy and the General Secretariat for the Environment, in collaboration with PlanAPP, it is the second of a set of initiatives in a collaborative, systematic and open process that aims to encourage the presentation of ideas and debates able to support the formulation of public policies, within the scope of the attributions of the Public Administration Planning and Foresight Services Network (RePLAN), with the objective of producing a “Report on Megatrends with Impact on Portugal” by the end of this year.</li>

This sustainability transition will be key to strengthen the EU's Open Strategic Autonomy, ensure its long-term competitiveness, uphold its social market economy model and consolidate its global leadership in the new net-zero economy. To succeed, the EU will need to address several challenges and make choices that will affect our societies and economies at an unprecedented pace and scale.<br><br>The 2023 report provides an overview of the challenges we face and proposes ten areas for action to achieve a successful transition. To equip policymakers with economic indicators which also consider wellbeing, it proposes to adjust Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to take account of different factors such as health and the environment.<br><br>This approach will bolster the EU's Open Strategic Autonomy and global standing in its pursuit of a resilient net-zero economy.&nbsp;</p>
","<p><strong>Overcoming key social and economic challenges</strong><br><br>As it goes through the sustainability transition – which encompasses both economic and social sustainability ­– the EU is facing several challenges. For example:<br><br>•	Evolving geopolitical shifts are shaping public opinion and how governments across the globe act, challenging international cooperation on global issues, such as climate change or the energy transition.<br>•	The need for a new economic model, focused on the wellbeing of people and nature, decoupling economic growth from resource use and shifting to more sustainable production and consumption. Up to 75% of Eurozone businesses are highly dependent on natural resources. Economic, social and environmental sustainability are inextricably linked.<br>•	Growing demand for adequate skills for a sustainable future. The availability of workers equipped with appropriate technical and soft skills will be crucial for the EU's competitiveness: 85% of EU firms today lack staff with the competences needed to navigate the green and digital transitions.<br>•	The sustainability transition requires unprecedented investments. Achieving it will depend on securing sufficient funding both from the public and private sectors.<br><br><strong>Ten areas for action</strong><br>Today's report identifies ten areas where our policy response is needed to ensure that the sustainability transition remains focused on the wellbeing of people and society:<br><br>1. Ensure a new European social contract with renewed welfare policies and a focus on high-quality social services.<br>2. Deepen the Single Market to champion a resilient net-zero economy, with a focus on Open Strategic Autonomy and economic security.<br>3. Boost the EU's offer on the global stage to strengthen cooperation with key partners.<br>4. Support shifts in production and consumption towards sustainability, targeting regulation and fostering balanced lifestyles.<br>5. Move towards a ‘Europe of investments' through public action to catalyse financial flows for the transitions.<br>6. Make public budgets fit for sustainability through an efficient tax framework and public spending.<br>7. Further shift policy and economic indicators towards sustainable and inclusive wellbeing, including by adjusting GDP for different factors.<br>8. Ensure that all Europeans can contribute to the transition by increasing labour market participation and focusing on future skills.<br>9. Strengthen democracy with generational fairness at the heart of policymaking to reinforce the support for the transitions.<br>10. Complement civil protection with ‘civil prevention' by reinforcing the EU's toolbox on preparedness and response.</p>

A new futures research study from the University of Turku maps multiple pathways and tensions that could transform how universities teach, research, and serve society. </strong></p>
","<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Researchers of the University of Turku have published a comprehensive report ""<em>Future directions and possibilities for the university: Report on literature review and Delphi study</em>"" (Virmajoki et al. 2024) about the possible future trajectories of the university of Turku. The report, which is uploaded here and also available on <a href=""https://www.utupub.fi/handle/10024/179116"" target=""_blank"">utupub.fi</a>, is part of a larger project - <a href=""https://sites.utu.fi/sfi/"" target=""_blank"">Strategic Foresight and Futures Thinking Initiative</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report, conducted by the Strategic Planning Unit of the University of Turku together with Finland Futures Research Centre (<a href=""https://www.utu.fi/en/university/turku-school-of-economics/finland-futures-research-centre"" target=""_blank"">FFRC</a>), contains the results of the analysis of the operating environment of universities. Operating environment here refers to the broader context of trends, challenges, and conditions - both nationally and globally - that affect how universities function and perform their core activities in teaching and research. While the report has as its scope the University of Turku, its findings and especially the approach are more broadly relevant, particularly in Europe.</p>
","<p><strong>Analysis of Operating Environment as Research</strong><br>The analysis of the operating environment was primarily based on a literature review and a subsequent Delphi survey. We reviewed over 200 scientific texts relevant to the subject. It quickly became evident how multifaceted and unique universities are. Scenarios—a common tool in foresight—would not be sufficient on their own to understand the possible futures of universities. Therefore, we first categorised universities into 10 different dimensions, such as societal purpose, international orientation, and educational organization, and identified different directions for development for each dimension. This allowed us to create a multidimensional description of possible development paths for universities, yielding in total 30 different paths and their combinations. The reality is somewhere between the idealized end-points.</p>
<p>In addition to helping understand various possible futures, the analysis where several dimensions and their paths are explained also provides a tool for the university units to examine their own position in relation to these possible developments. University units can differ significantly from one another, and no analytical tool that accounts for these differences can be sufficient. Our report offers such a tool by enabling discussion – with agreements and disagreements – of different development trajectories from the perspectives of diverse traditions and practices that can be found within any university.</p>
<p><strong>Possibilities and Desirability – The Delphi Study</strong><br>It was not only important to understand the possible futures universities may face. Equally crucial at the University of Turku was to understand what university members – researchers, students, administration, and other staff – think about these futures. To achieve such understanding, we conducted a Delphi study to ask what university members consider probable and desirable when it comes to the future. The statements were designed to provoke thoughts and bring out views that might not emerge in more traditional discussions. In addition to the probability and desirability assessments, we gathered valuable insights from the open comment sections, which often reveal perspectives that might be overlooked in the literature review.</p>
<p><strong>Some Key Results</strong><br>While the most interesting results cannot all be included in this text, some should be highlighted to provide a sense of the nature of the study.</p>
<p>First, universities are continuously balancing societal impact, economic goals, and fundamental research. The demands from the side of the wider society often pull in different directions. The Delphi study showed that working towards a societal mission is seen as desirable, but market orientation is expected to be more likely. A common thought and worry seems to be that universities are likely to shift towards more commercial interests, despite the tension this creates with their social responsibilities not measurable in economic terms.<br><br>Second, global research collaboration and local relevance create a significant tension. Universities aim to be part of global networks, while also expected to contribute to their local communities. The Delphi study revealed varying opinions on this balance. Some see global engagement as essential, while others stress the importance of local ties. Whether a university can succeed in both areas or must focus on one is a central question. The geopolitical tensions and the regional clusters this might create adds another path that might make the question between local and global even more difficult and multidimensional.</p>
<p>Third, in teaching, the main tension seems to lie between scalable, mass-oriented education and more personalised, tailored teaching. Scalable teaching allows universities to reach more students, but the Delphi study showed that personalized methods are considered more desirable. Yet, the study also indicated that standardised models are, according to the members of the university, more likely to prevail due to the scarcity of resources. Technology and its development will be an integral part of both scalable and personalised teaching paths (and everything in between) but different technological solutions might be associated with different paths.</p>
<p><strong>Significance for the University Sector</strong><br>The project and the report highlight the value of combining an analysis of the university operating environment and a more detailed study of the views of the university community. On the one hand, an analysis of the environment and the paths therein provides a tool to navigate the prospects and risks. On the other hand, the analysis of the members’ perspective helps the university understand where we stand now and what are the paths that the members recognise. Together, these two provide a robust view on the strategic status and importance of different possible trajectories for universities’ operating environment.</p>
<p>The research has broad applicability across universities worldwide. Through its dimensions and models, any higher education institution can map out and discuss likely trajectories, desired directions, and concerning paths ahead - regardless of their unique features. By combining extensive research literature with a Delphi study, the report opens a window into the possible futures of universities – or rather a map that can be used to navigate the long-term issues that these long-standing institutions face.<br><br><strong>References</strong><br>Virmajoki, V., Ahokas, I., Witoon, S., Ahlqvist, T., Kirveennummi, A., &amp; Suomalainen, K.-M.

<p>The workshop offered a structured journey—reflecting on the past of liberal democracies, examining current research on key pillars like institutions, participation, and media, and exploring possible futures through the lens of four science fiction novels that imagine future democratic developments</p>
<ul>
<li>Senior scientist at “<strong>Our World in Data</strong>”, <strong>Bastian Herre</strong> gave an alarming as well as reconciling view into the deterioration of liberal democracies worldwide as well as in Europe. Yet, he pointed out that most of our present democracies are built on solid institutions and they are most likely to be resilient against internal and external attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Michel Debruyne</strong> of <strong>Beweging.net</strong> introduced results from comparative country research from the <strong>INVOLVE Democracy</strong> project. Among the factors stablizing liberal democracies long-term are the quality of trust in public institutions and policies as well as making participation possible for all citizens. However, when looking at public policies and social benefits, the picture is more ambiguous: while public health expenditure is considered a stabilizing factor, high expenditure in pensions might result in distrust. More definite in destabilizing democracy in a country are corruption and low quality of public transport.</li>
<li>The <strong>RECLAIM project</strong> is researching the significance of expression of information disorder and democratic stability. The protection of the public sphere is identified as a cornerstone of democracy. Of similar importance are public service social media as well as a better regulation of social media companies. In his presentation<strong> Maximilian Conrad</strong>, University of Iceland, also pointed out the significance of the education factor, not only for children but also for adults, including science education and media literacy. Destabilizing factors are, among others, disruptive technologies, fragmented public spheres and distrust in traditional journalism and science.</li>
<li>In the <strong>MeDeMAP</strong> presentation, <strong>Maren Beaufort</strong>,<strong> Austrian Academy of Sciences</strong> focused on the role of (social) media and stated that traditional information media and pluralism, thinking long-term and endorsing a culture of diversity are crucial in maintaining democratic values. Investigative journalism plays a special role as it uncovers corrupt activities and disguised the foes of democracy. What we cannot expect is a consensus in social media bubbles. Definitely destabilizing liberal democracies is the exclusion of citizens from discourses; and also the suppression of media as well as the lack of self-criticism within journalism. Still open are questions such as: How to prevent democracies dying at the hands of elected leaders—who subvert the very process that brought them to power.</li>
<li>An outlook into diverse futures of democratic values was presented in the “<strong>Literary Quartet</strong>”, where four passionate readers of science fiction literature gave their interpretation of four different novels dedicated to the longevity of democratic life in the future. What we can learn from novel like <em>Infomocracy</em> (2016), <em>The Lost Cause</em> (2023), <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> (1969), and <em>The Ministry for the Future</em> (2020)? The discussion extracted visions of pluralist and diverse societies where humans can change their identity, experiment with new forms of governance in local communities, where central governments are resolved and where people find ways to cope with climate change by supporting each other.</li>
</ul>
","<p>This workshop is part of a series of “Eye of Europe” pilot activities taking place during 2025, aimed at exploring various futures and their implications for R&amp;I policy.</p>
<p>The workshop was open to a wide audience - experts and non-experts - interested in questions of future democracies.</p>

","<p>Welcome to the 26th WFSF World Conference<br><br>In recent years and decades, the world has witnessed a rapid increase in alarming developments—ranging from natural and man-made disasters to geopolitical upheavals, systemic breakdowns, and the erosion of long-established world orders. These profound shifts have shaken the foundations of societies and generated uncertainty, confusion, and despair across global communities.<br><br>From the destabilization of democratic institutions to the accelerating consequences of climate change, we are facing a convergence of challenges that affect every dimension of human life—economic, ecological, technological, political, legal, and social. Many of these disruptions are not random but are deeply rooted in man-made structures and actions, raising urgent questions about responsibility, preparedness, and the paths forward.<br><br>“Thriving Together” is not just a call for resilience—it is a collective invitation to envision and co-create futures where individuals, groups, and societies can move beyond survival and into sustainable flourishing. As we reorient ourselves in a landscape of risk and uncertainty, this conference will explore the critical question: How should we respond, and what long-term strategies, values, and transformations must we consider to thrive—together?<br><br>This gathering aims to foster deep reflection and bold dialogue across disciplines and sectors. It will bring together voices from around the world to discuss:<br><br>Adaptive capacities in times of disruption<br>Democratic renewal and social cohesion<br>Ecological sustainability and climate resilience<br>Technological responsibility and innovation<br>Shared narratives for hopeful and inclusive futures<br>In the spirit of mutual learning, collaboration, and care, this conference will create a space to explore what it truly means to thrive—not alone, but together.<br><br>The in-person conference will be hosted by the Institute for Futures Research and Stellenbosch Business School  in Bellville, Cape Town. The conference aims to bring together 150 participants from all over the world to share their thinking and research on possible futures.<br><br></p>

Organized by the <strong>Alliance of Democracies Foundation </strong>in collaboration with local partner <strong>Yep Moldova </strong>and supported by <strong>USAID </strong>and the <strong>New Democracy Fund</strong>, the event was a hub of creativity, democratic innovation and a dose of foresight.</p>
","<p>Moldova’s position as a frontline state—nestled between the EU and the Russian sphere of influence—places it at the heart of some of the most pressing geopolitical challenges. But it also underscores its immense potential. As the nation voted on embedding EU membership into its constitution, the stakes couldn’t have been higher.</p>
<p>My role was twofold: speaking at the accompanying conference about democratizing futures and mentoring young entrepreneurs during a hackathon focused on democracy tech. Even from someone with an innovation background myself, I was really inspired by ingenuity at display at the hackathon and how societally focused the teams were in terms of problem-solving. The young people didn’t investigate community-level issues. Instead, the teams tackled complex challenges like combating misinformation, increasing government transparency, and driving civic engagement—issues that resonate far beyond Moldova’s borders.</p>
<p>The winning team developed an innovative blockchain solution for increased transparency in the policy-making process, earning them a spot at the prestigious Copenhagen Democracy Summit next year. Watching their pitches reminded me why I have turned some of my focus towards working with youth: they bring bold ideas and unfiltered perspectives that are needed to challenge the status quo. They are not in the same way weighted down by ‘we have done this before, it didn’t work’ and many of them possess a healthy dose of idealism in a cynical world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides that, it was humbling to exchange ideas with leaders, activists, and entrepreneurs who are on the frontlines of democracy innovation. Amid deepfakes, cyberattacks, and disinformation campaigns—a grim reality in Moldova’s context—these discussions felt urgent and necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Foresight and democracy: Two critically linked visions</strong></p>
<p>At the conference, my talk revolved around the critical link between foresight and democracy. As I shared with the audience, democracy thrives on inclusivity, adaptability, and a long-term vision. By engaging citizens, especially young people, in structured yet imaginative futures-thinking exercises, we can help reimagine democratic systems to become more resilient and relevant. We need much more of this work, because democracy also needs to be driven from the bottom-up.</p>
","<p>The conference unfolded against a tense political backdrop. The week after my visit, Moldova narrowly passed its EU referendum with just 50.4% of the vote, while pro-European President Maia Sandu advanced to the second round of elections (that she later won. With the elections heavily shadowed by Russian interference, these slim margins are a reminder of the resilience required to uphold democratic values in the face of external pressures, particularly from Russian propaganda and influence.</p>
<p>This moment in Moldova reflects a broader narrative playing out across Europe (and the West): the fight to safeguard democracy is ongoing and not just in Eastern Europe. It’s not enough to simply look to protect institutions but also about empowering individuals—particularly the next generation—to co-create democratic systems that work for everyone.</p>
<p>Since my trip, I have reflected a lot on how I can take the learnings into my work. These young entrepreneurs and changemakers truly showed me that democracy really isn’t just about elections; it’s about constant innovation, participation, and foresight. This is one of the most meaningful initiatives, I have been a part, continuing the work on a workshop called Democratizing Futures Lab that I held in Copenhagen in the Spring for entrepreneurs from the frontline democracies Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. Even when the threat is existential, this work has reaffirmed my belief that by equipping people with the tools to imagine and shape their futures, we can help create democratic systems that are not only resilient but also inclusive and forward-looking.</p>
<p>Moldova may be small, but its fight for democracy holds lessons for us all. The futures are shaped not just by policies or geopolitics but by the collective vision of those daring enough to imagine a better tomorrow.</p>

The result is a continent that often appears paralysed, not because Europe lacks vision, but because national short-term politics keep overwhelming shared commitments. From a futurist’s perspective, this constant firefighting is a dangerous distraction: it blinds us to the signals of tomorrow that are already here, and are waiting to be scaled.<br><br>Recent examples make this clear. Germany’s government backtracked on climate legislation after a backlash over household heating rules, diluting one of Europe’s key steps toward net zero. France fought to have nuclear reclassified as “green” in the EU’s taxonomy, fracturing momentum on renewables. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni struck unilateral deals with Tunisia to block migrant boats, undermining solidarity in the Union. Hungary has repeatedly vetoed European aid to Ukraine, while Poland demands coal exemptions from EU climate targets. Each of these cases shows how fragmented agendas chip away at collective credibility.</p>
","<p>At the same time, undercurrents of religious tension ripple across the continent. In Kosovo, interethnic violence flared again when Serb militants attacked Kosovo police, prompting fresh NATO deployment. In Sweden, public Quran burnings sparked international protests and forced Denmark to reinstate legal protections against religious desecration. Both cases reveal how fragile coexistence remains when provocation and division are left unchecked.<br><br>Yet these fractures do not tell the whole story. From a futurist standpoint, they appear less as isolated crises and more as early tremors in the bedrock of a new Europe being built. Across the continent, in politics, ecology, peace, faith, and now digital economies — we see fractal experiments that hint at structural change. These are not merely responses to the present; they are signals of possibility.<br><br>In the futures community, platforms like Futures4Europe have been mapping such catalytic shifts, exploring “symbiotic futures” where governance, urban resilience, and collective intelligence converge. Similarly, major foresight surveys — like the Atlantic Council’s Global Foresight 2025 — frame phenomena such as misinformation targeting Gen Z, enhanced geothermal energy, and undersea infrastructure vulnerabilities as potential pivot points for our decades ahead. All of these highlight the same imperative: the need to invest in more resilient communities that can withstand shocks while nurturing trust and cohesion. Seen through this lens, today’s emergent resilience patterns — from ecovillage-led circular economies to fintech-enabled sustainability and feminist peacebuilding — are not isolated stories. They are the outlines of Europe’s next possible architecture, waiting to be assembled with purpose.</p>
","<p><strong>Politics</strong>: <a href=""https://volteuropa.org/"" target=""_blank"">Volt Europa</a>, the continent’s first pan-European political party, challenges the deeply rooted assumption that democracy must be bounded by nationality. Its modest gains in the 2024 European Parliament elections — securing new seats in Germany, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria — were significant in meaning. They showed that a constituency exists for citizens who see themselves as European first, who want representation that transcends the borders where nationalism has been resurgent. In a political landscape still dominated by parties that speak only to national electorates, Volt’s experiment stands as proof that shared sovereignty is not just a bureaucratic idea in Brussels, but a lived political identity.<br><br>The symbolic weight of Volt’s emergence lies in how it reframes the question of belonging. Against the backdrop of populist retrenchment in Hungary, Italy, and parts of France, Volt insists that Europe’s strength lies in unity. While some critics may dismiss it as marginal, the party is already shaping debates about cross-border democracy, transnational climate policy, and youth participation — a vital pillar in any architecture for the future. In futurist terms, Volt is a maturing prototype: a signal that citizens are prepared to imagine political belonging beyond the nation-state, even before institutions catch up.<br><br><strong>Planet</strong>: Ecovillages across Europe are more than just experiments in alternative living; they are prototypes for how communities might thrive within the realities of ecological limits, driven by the <a href=""https://ecovillage.org/"" target=""_blank"">Global Ecovillage Network</a>. In Boekel, the Netherlands, a climate-positive settlement, built with hempcrete and powered by solar micro-grids, has been supported through EU Smart Regions funding. In Scotland, the Findhorn Ecovillage community’s recent buy-out secured the legacy of one of Europe’s most pioneering low-impact settlements.<br><br>What is striking is that Europe’s institutions are beginning to recognise the value of such grassroots models. The European Commission’s New European Bauhaus initiative explicitly draws on ecovillage design principles — combining architecture, sustainability, and community — to reimagine urban and rural living. Horizon Europe funds now channel millions into “positive energy districts” and community-led renewable schemes that echo the governance and design practices long pioneered by ecovillages. What began on the margins is now being absorbed into policy blueprints. This convergence suggests that Europe’s future resilience will not be invented in Brussels alone, but built on lessons from grassroots communities that have been living the future for decades.<br><br><strong>Economy</strong>: The architecture of tomorrow cannot rest only on political will and social movements; it also depends on how Europe chooses to structure its economy and regulate emerging technologies. The circular economy is no longer a distant aspiration: the European Union is preparing Digital Product Passports under its Ecodesign regulation, set to roll out by 2026, which will allow every item sold in Europe to carry a traceable record of its materials, emissions, and reparability. This is a systemic innovation, embedding circularity into markets themselves. Fintech developments are accelerating the shift: carbon-tracking apps such as Yayzy, emissions accounting platforms like Greenly, and green crowdfunding for regenerative agriculture through HeavyFinance’s InSoil, are enabling citizens and enterprises to align everyday choices with a sustainable future.<br><br>At the same time, Europe is asserting itself as a global rule-setter in the digital domain. The AI Act, adopted in 2024, represents the first comprehensive attempt anywhere in the world to regulate artificial intelligence, while GDPR continues to shape data protection standards far beyond Europe’s borders. These are not just technical regulations — they are anticipatory choices that reveal the kind of digital society Europe imagines for decades ahead. Taken together, circular finance, fintech innovation, and digital regulation form the beginnings of an economic and technological architecture that could underpin a resilient Europe, if leaders are prepared to build on these foundations with courage, rather than hesitation.<br><br><strong>Peace</strong>: Europe increasingly distinguishes itself by institutionalising women’s leadership in peacebuilding—not just as a value, but as a measurable component of strategy. In March 2025, the European Parliament convened a high-level conference emphasising that women’s participation makes peace negotiations more durable and justice-oriented. Evidence bears this out: peace agreements involving women have a 20% higher chance of lasting two years, and 35% higher odds of surviving fifteen years. Building on its 2019–2024 Women, Peace, and Security Action Plan, the EU has now carried this agenda forward into the new 2025–2029 cycle, embedding women’s voices across foreign, security, and development policymaking as a matter of course rather than exception.<br><br>But this momentum isn’t only top-down—it is fuelled by women-led movements, whose actions are reverberating. The <a href=""https://wilpf.org"" target=""_blank"">Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom</a> intervened at COP28 in 2023 to call out the omission of military emissions from climate dialogues, forging a connection between disarmament and climate justice. Meanwhile, Women in Black’s sustained vigils across the continent embody peace through symbolic presence and moral clarity. These collective efforts show that Europe’s peace architecture isn’t being designed in conference rooms alone, but by women in everyday actions. For futurists, the significance lies in how these practices redefine security: not as stockpiles of arms, but as networks of trust that endure.<br><br><strong>Values</strong>: Religious tensions have repeatedly tested Europe’s social fabric in recent years, from Quran desecrations in Sweden that sparked international protest, to interethnic clashes in northern Kosovo where Orthodox and Muslim communities remain in fragile coexistence. These incidents have shown that cultural provocations can quickly spill into diplomatic crises. Policymakers have begun to respond: Denmark reintroduced legal protections against religious desecration in 2023, and the European Commission now funds programmes to counter anti-Muslim hatred alongside its 2021–2030 strategy on combating antisemitism. In parallel, <a href=""https://rfpeurope.org/"" target=""_blank"">Religions for Peace</a> and other networks  have convened interfaith leaders to create common ground where politics alone cannot reach. These interventions show that Europe is beginning to treat cultural coexistence as a matter of security, not ornament.<br><br>For a futurist, the significance lies in how such initiatives function as resilience infrastructure. Communities that cultivate trust across lines of belief are less vulnerable to disinformation peddled by populists, external bad faith actors, or extremists who seek to weaponise identity. Just as renewable grids decentralise energy, interfaith dialogues decentralise social trust, ensuring it does not collapse under pressure. Far from being peripheral, these practices point to the foundations of Europe’s future stability: by institutionalising dialogue, Europe signals that its values are not reducible to treaties or markets, and that it is determined to live up to these in the face of polycrisis.<br><br><strong>Together</strong>, these currents — political, ecological, technological, feminist, and interfaith — do not yet form a completed structure. But they are the foundations of the architecture Europe requires if it is to remain more than a collection of crisis responses. The futurist’s task is not prediction, but recognition: to see in today’s scattered signals the outlines of tomorrow’s order. Europe already possesses the fragments of an architecture fit for the future. The question is whether its leaders will assemble them by design — or allow crisis after crisis to assemble them, by collapse.</p>

The work followed two important directions that were recommended by EFFLA (2012)1 as <strong>core elements of bringing foresight into EU R&amp;I policy: knowledge-based review and broad engagement.</strong><br><br>Knowledge based review was conducted with the help of the 40 experts who constituted the team that worked on the project. All these experts have contributed as authors to the authorship of the different chapters of this report. About 300 additional experts contributed to the project through its numerous workshops that helped shape the scenarios and ideas about their policy implications, and through membership in the on-line platform of the project at www.futures4europe.eu, which reached 307 people.

These were discussed in online workshops and on www.futures4europe.eu.<br>• An outlook on emerging developments in the global and European context of EU R&amp;I policy was developed drawing on a major online workshop in autumn 2021 with some 60 participants, experts and policy makers, who worked with <strong>multi-level context scenarios and specific context narratives</strong> about emerging disruptions.<br>• On that basis and in close consultation with the European Commission involving another major workshop in February 2022 which brought together 80 participants, Expert Teams were set up to develop disruptive scenarios in five areas of major interest. Each team ran several internal workshops but also involved further experts and Commission staff in their work, both through the online platform and through a final policy-oriented workshop. The foresight work within the areas of interest resulted in  <strong>five deep dives </strong>on the following topics:<br> <strong>  &gt; Climate change, Research, and Innovation: Radical Options from Social Change to Geoengineering</strong><br><strong>   &gt; Hydrogen Economy – A radical alternative</strong><br><strong>   &gt; The EU in a Volatile New World - The challenge of global leadership </strong><br><strong>   &gt; Global Commons</strong><br><strong>   &gt; Transhumanist Revolutions</strong><br>• Further areas of interest identified since were explored through review papers aiming to capture major trends, developments and scenario sketches in relation to further disruptive developments<br> <strong>&gt; Social Confrontations</strong><br><strong>    &gt; Artificial General Intelligence: Issues and Opportunities</strong><br><strong>    &gt; The Interpenetration of Criminal and Lawful Economic Activities </strong><br><strong>    &gt; The Future of Health</strong><br>• A third major workshop took place in October 2022 bringing together all the thematic strands of work and addressing <strong>possible R&amp;I policy implications</strong> from this work. Participation in this workshop reached 250 individuals over 2 days.<br>• Building on the workshop, the online <strong>Dynamic Argumentative Delphi survey Research4Futures</strong> collect suggestions from further experts and citizens about the implications of this foresight work for the priorities of EU R&amp;I policy.<br><br><strong>This foresight study has been the most widely engaging foresight exercise yet aiming to support EU R&amp;I policy</strong>. Through this broad engagement, the study did not only develop intelligence for the 2nd Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe but also contributed to the development of an EU R&amp;I foresight community, one that is an asset for future R&amp;I policies across Europe.&nbsp;</p>

These very large private companies are leaders in research and development (R&amp;D) and now wield unprecedented and unparalleled influence in the economy and beyhond.  In this redefined world, Europe faces a number of agenda-setting questions. This policy brief aims to anticipate the implications of ‘Big Tech’ for Europe’s future by 2040.</p>
<p><strong>The future(s) of Big Tech: Questions, challenges, strategies for Europe</strong><br><br>Big Tech are here to stay. But they do not stay the same. They have a hunger for innovation. In terms of R&amp;D, the top 5 US Big Tech spend in a single year more than the double of what the EU-27 committed collectively to the Horizon Europe, which runs for seven years. Big Tech corporates leverage cloud infrastructure, digital platform business models, and increasingly AI technologies to capture expansive market positions and to achieve superior performance. Another obvious fact is that these economic titans are not from Europe.<br><br>A set of questions thus suggest themselves: In a market-driven economy, does it matter for Europe? If it matters, will conventional remedies like regulation and competition policy be enough to cope with the ramifications? Is it time to go post-neoliberal phase and engage in informational industrial activism of a disruptive kind? Or, on the contrary, will bottom-up decentralised entrepreneurial incrementalism sort out any temporary European competitiveness and governance failures?<br><br>In a new report to the European Commission, these four questions are dealt with by means of a scenario-building exercise. Four authors, who also counted with inputs from 30 experts from industry and academia, make an attempt to anticipate how the European Union can regain its edge in a world re-wired by Big Tech.<br><br>Four scenarios put forward alternative challenges for the year 2040 from a Research &amp; Innovation perspective (see Box). Scenario 1 ‘Winners Tech All’ is a world of high openness and mega-economies of scale and scope. In contrast, scenario 2 ‘Pax Technologica’ could be seen as a robustly negotiated multipolar environment. Scenario 3, ‘Re-matching’, envisions the recovery of a mixed tech economy where alternatives to incumbent Big Tech are viable. Finally, Scenario 4 is called ‘Closet Liberalism’and portrays a low-obstruction/wide-arena world where self-organised economic dynamics propel Europe back onto the global competitive map.<br><br>The policy implications are considered. The policy posture across scenarios and strategic stances for each scenario is rooted in three basic premises, i.e. the imperative to: protect pluralism (economic and societal), maintain a cosmopolitan outlook (in world affairs), and safeguard natural commons (including Earth and orbital resources). Based on these assumptions and the scenario analysis, number of strategic conclusions are drawn.<br></p>
<p>Out of the general and scenario-specific portfolios that were generated, a number headline policy options can be considered:<br><br>- The EU should reinforce and develop its own regulations and anti-monopolistic actions to constrain the market power of Big Tech Companies, but these are not sufficient to ensure autonomous economic development and well-being in the EU;<br><br>- It is needed that a new generation of European productive actors emerges to generate a productive capacity of the old continent in new infrastructuring fields, and if these are built as cross-European state-owned entities this is an option not to be disregarded.<br><br>- The EU Framework Programme and national research and innovation (R&amp;I) budgets should be benchmarked not only against their past performance but also compared to the spending and strategies of Big Tech;<br><br>- ‘Big bet’ investments are needed in Europe, coupled with more serendipity-inducing experimental approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario sketches</strong><br><br>Scenario 1: Winners tech all<br><br>This is a story of modernisation orchestrated around digital high-tech. The economy is not run by Big Tech but on infrastructures these private companies own and hone. Growing dependencies can be tolerated because benefits are shared and businesses are empowered to pursue their plans. The operating framework inherited from Globalisation assures a modicum of stability, namely informal institutions like the G7 or the G20 and formal institutions like the IMF and the World Bank. The US remains the sole superpower and maintains its role as agenda-setter. The room for manoeuvre for the EU is limited and it takes its place in the international division of labour.<br><br>Scenario 2: Pax technologica<br><br>The economy is a negotiated tension between pro-global business interests and pro-local (local referring to groups of countries with aligned interests cooperating and competing with each other, forming coopetitive clubs) political constraints. The drive to take advantage of economies of scale and scope has been tamed by enhanced regulation and hardened borders. Supply-chains are splintered and directed towards suppliers within the mega-regions composed of preferential partners, increasing costs but reducing uncertainty. Existing large tech firms must accommodate each other. Existing platform models are entrenched but are forced to grant access to their digital and logistic facilities, leading newcomers to not investing in their own subversive infrastructure. Stability is a value, not so much efficiency. The US retains its role as an economic-financial and political-military switchboard, but for a diminishing part of the globe. China is still challenging the dominance of the US both politically and economically. Other regional powers emerge. The EU is a switchboard of external and internal pressures, and this is the “Brussels Consensus”.<br><br>Scenario 3: Re-matching<br><br>What shapes the development of individual nations regions is their own path in a pluralist international scene. Pro-active productive policy makes sense, especially if coordinated among players. After years of blitz-scaling the tide turned, and Big Tech went into a fizzdown. Cross-regional/trans-sectoral innovative players gained mass and found expansive growth niches at key intersections of a complex (mix) economy with an active role of the public sector associated to national governments and international organizations. Commons governance generate citizen engagement and global fragmentation is controlled. An overstretched self-consumed US has to divide protagonism with other world powers. The EU is a network builder, it supports the catalysing and protection of the new core-inputs of the modernising economy.<br><br>Scenario 4: Closet liberalism<br><br>In this world commercial and financial integration proceeds and power continues to trespass national borders and overwhelm States. Large multinationals are seen to have a large impact in public governance, but tech monopolies matured becoming expensive and bad quality. There is a mesh of networks and competing authorities create an opportunity for decentralisation, especially at the local and city levels. The US serves its own interests and is more reluctant to assume its responsibilities in global public good provision. The EU preaches the superiority of the market order, but inside the EU everyone tries to re-interpret the rules of the game in its own benefit (fiscal responsibility is for the population not for businesses).</p>

","<p>The workshop began with a presentation by members of the Foresight on Demand Consortium, aiming to explore the future of science for policy and more specifically knowledge exchange processes between knowledge actors and policymakers, with the intention to produce scientifically informed policy in Europe. The presentation outlined scenarios rooted in developments, trends, and drivers that are currently underway providing a glimpse into potential characteristics that might define the landscape in the 2030s. The scenarios were developed around two key dimensions for the governance of science: the extent to which government directs science and the extent of stakeholder engagement in the shaping of scientific agendas. Drawing from previously identified trends such as Citizen Science, Open Science, Mission-driven research and innovation, and data-driven policy, the team identified five scenario narratives as shown below.</p>
","<p>All scenarios, departed from trends already identified within the European R&amp;I system and opened the floor for in-depth discussions concerning the future Science for Policy and policy governance. The discussion that ensued between the speakers and the workshop participants raised points about the future of science for policy and the potential evolution of current R&amp;I policy:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Foresight and Science for Policy:</strong> Certain scenarios speculated that Foresight will not, in the future, be practiced as it was before – as a response to crises – but will be integrated in political agenda setting for R&amp;I. This could render traditional Science for Policy redundant, as it could become an intrinsic element of policy initiatives. In this setting, scientific advice would be co-created through diverse frameworks rather than coming from a single institutionalized source.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mapping Scenarios: </strong>During the discussions, the intricate nature of European R&amp;I systems was highlighted. Participants proposed that Member States be encouraged to undertake similar scenario-building exercises, which can have the benefit of drawing all relevant stakeholders around the table. This approach could enable the creation of viable roadmaps based on these scenarios and assess the alignment of these streams with National and European initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing Systemic Failures in Science and Democracy: </strong>The discussion also touched upon the democratization of scientific processes leading to considerations about cultivating openness and transparency and encouraging the multidisciplinary nature and the involvement of actors beyond just the scientific realm. <a href=""https://bioagora.eu/"" target=""_blank"">Bio Agora</a>, for example, which aims to develop the Science Service for European Research and Biodiversity Policy Making, actively contributes to breaking the silo thinking in science, society and policy, and showcased its approach in a subsequent presentation. Similarly, the PHIRI project (Population Health and Research Infrastructure, <a href=""https://www.phiri.eu/"" target=""_blank"">PHIRI</a>) presented its approach for best gathering available evidence for research on health and well-being of populations impacted by Covid-19. Through the input gathered from various stakeholders in different member states, PHIRI showcased how they adopted a multi-stakeholder approach to develop scenarios that are insightful for understanding the challenges for public health in the short and long term using the expertise of people from diverse backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, audience feedback suggested broadening the scope of the prospective analysis conducted on the Future of Science for Policy. This expansion could encompass the involvement and contributions of stakeholders in policy governance who extend beyond the scientific community. This approach aims to achieve a more comprehensive and systemic understanding of the subject matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project presentations further led to insightful conversations on the strategic significance of Foresight and collaborative governance methods as valuable aspects for addressing deliberative issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of Temporality: While it is essential to strive for a better understanding of the future, equal emphasis should be placed on comprehending the present. As Henk Hilderink, Public Health Foresight Expert at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) said: ""If we wait until we understand what the present is, then we are never going to look at the future”.</li>
<li>Collaborative governance methods: Discussions revolved around identifying the appropriate Collaborative Governance Practices. This entails a keen focus on leveraging Emerging Technologies to facilitate methods conducive to achieving collaborative multilevel governance.</li>

Concern for what we call ""the future of work"" is part of this mosaic. Regardless of their geographical space, people think of their work as being, in varying doses, a source of material well-being, but also a component of their identity. Uncertainties about how will people work in the future – how will they earn income and build a purpose, a meaning through their work – is an important topic, and often a source of concern.<br>What are we heading for? What kind of future is desirable? What is possible, respectively probable, from what we deem desirable? What can be done to get there? All these are legitimate questions that deserve our attention.<br>In the context of recent waves of technological progress, the future of work is the subject of intensive controversy. Often in the public space there is an overwhelming emphasis on the impact of new technologies on work, neglecting other shaping forces relevant to labor market dynamics. <strong>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to open a wider conversation about the future of work on the 2030 horizon.</strong><br><br>The perspective used in this paper is a causal and hierarchical one: from drivers of change towards their impact on labor. Most studies on labor market developments start from a context modeled by several global megatrends. Following this logic,<strong> the second chapter describes the four main trends</strong> identified in literature: i) <strong>technological developments</strong>, especially automation; ii) <strong>globalization</strong>, especially cross-border flows and widening inequalities; iii) <strong>demographic changes</strong>, in particular the ageing population in the global North; iv) <strong>climate change</strong>, environmental degradation and the development of the green economy.<br>Within these trends, ongoing or likely transformations have been identified that have or could have an impact on global labor market dynamics. The section describing each megatrend is accompanied by a box with what we call ""<strong>signals of change</strong>"" - contextualizing empirical data that serve as justifications/explanations of the phenomena described in that section. In the context of the global transformations we outline here, <strong>the fourth chapter presents a catalogue of emerging occupations</strong>, by which we mean both existing (highly dynamic) or incipient occupations and occupations that do not yet exist but are likely to exist in 2030 or beyond<br>The third chapter was added later in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and is a brief overview of the transformations in the global labor market – some already visible, others likely - due to this global crisis.</p>

Based on a participatory workshop involving people from the region’s ecosystem, the study highlights, beyond a favorable investment climate, human capital and a supportive culture as key ingredients for the future of innovation in Central Macedonia. </em></p>
<p><br>Innovation will save us. Or maybe not. Often presented as the “recipe” for economic growth and improved performance indicators — a kind of magic formula known only to a select few — innovation tends to be treated as an exclusive club, with unknown entry requirements.</p>
<p><br>In reality, things are quite different, though. The African proverb “it takes a village to raise a child” applies perfectly to innovation: a process inherently collaborative and adaptable to constantly changing external conditions. Even the emergence of a single new idea depends on mechanisms often invisible to the naked eye — systems and networks of people who interact, exchange ideas, and share experiences. At the same time, global phenomena such as (geo)political turmoil, climate change and its impact on tourism and agriculture, and Artificial Intelligence with the automation of many processes, are redefining our priorities and needs, shaping new challenges and opportunities for innovation.</p>
","<p>As the global landscape changes rapidly, the future becomes increasingly unpredictable. While in 2040 you might be able to search <strong><em>Amphibio.net</em></strong> for recycling spots in your neighborhood, in another future the <strong><em>PloQ</em></strong> platform organizes your entire diet routine, <strong><em>Kentri.Co Point</em></strong> serves as a collaboration hub for the textile industry — a key sector for Central Macedonia’s economy. In yet another future, we vacation at the fully automated four-season <strong><em>Nymfes Resort</em></strong> on the plains of Olympus, trying to restore our relationship with nature. In another, we continue to build our homes with traditional but now environmentally friendly construction materials from <strong><em>Kely.fos.</em></strong></p>
<p><br>Parallel universes? Not exactly — these are fictional success stories that emerged from the five possible future scenarios explored in the “INNOVATION LANDSCAPE 2040” study, a participatory initiative by OSLO of the Region of Central Macedonia. Researchers, entrepreneurs, NGOs, public institutions, and citizens co-designed possible future scenarios for the region in 2040, discussed their implications for innovation, and proposed actions to strengthen resilience and foster new entrepreneurial activity — based on four different conditions: Growth, Discipline, Destruction, and Transformation.<br></p>
","<p>Although the resulting scenarios differed — some more optimistic, envisioning strong regional growth, others more cautious or even pessimistic — the paradox (or not) is that everyone agreed on what Central Macedonia truly needs:<br>(a) Investment in human capital, through skills development and talent attraction and retention (brain gain);<br>(b) Cultivation of a supportive culture, through open innovation initiatives, awareness-raising, and technology transfer; and<br>(c) Creation of an attractive investment environment, by encouraging investment, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking.</p>
<p><br>The conclusion? While business incentives and foreign investments are important, perhaps the most crucial factor is human capital: creative people who want to stay in the region — not only to start businesses, but also to develop knowledge networks, spread positive attitudes toward risk and innovation, and establish (formally or informally) mechanisms that support and promote new ideas.<br></p>

A “magic box” that opens only when logical rigor relaxes, when attention drifts toward invention and fantasy. Yet this view, however seductive, is ultimately reductive – if not misleading.<br><br>When examined through the lens of contemporary cognitive science, imagination instead reveals itself as a profound and complex cognitive function. Not only does it actively participate in processes of knowing, but it also constitutes one of their foundational dimensions. It is the mental faculty through which we construct alternative worlds, test hypothetical scenarios, and explore the unknown without needing to experience it directly. Far from being a mere appendage to rational thought, it serves as one of its key structural supports.<br><br>Even more striking is what emerges from recent scientific research: imagination possesses a metacognitive character. This means it does not merely generate mental content that diverges from reality, but is also capable of reflecting on itself – monitoring and adjusting its own trajectories, becoming the object of awareness and intentional regulation. In other words, imagining is not just about conjuring what is absent from the world, but also about knowing one is imagining, directing that act toward specific goals, and assessing its quality, limitations, and implications.<br><br>This represents a genuine epistemological shift – recasting imagination not as a passive or automatic process, but as a strategic ally of thought. Within this framework, imagination emerges as a faculty that weaves together multiple dimensions of our cognitive experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>perception, which provides sensory input;</li>
<li>intuition, which enables rapid, non-linear associations;</li>
<li>intentionality, which channels imaginative effort toward a purpose;</li>
<li>and self-awareness, which allows us to revise and reinterpret what has been imagined, imbuing it with meaning and value.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is within this layered and dynamic space that imagination assumes a renewed role: no longer a retreat into the unreal, but a critical tool for probing the possible. It becomes the lens through which we may observe not only what is, but what could be – and, through this, reconfigure our relationship with the present.<br><br><em>It enables us to anticipate without predicting, and to plan without constraining</em>.<br><br>In educational, professional, and social contexts – and even more so within the fields of Futures Thinking and Foresight – this reconceptualization of imagination as a metacognitive skill proves to be strategically essential. To anticipate the future is not to guess what will occur, but to cultivate a gaze that can recognize alternatives, navigate uncertainties, and imagine trajectories not yet in existence. Doing so requires more than creativity; it demands a deep literacy in conscious imagination.<br><br>To rediscover imagination through a metacognitive lens is to restore its dignity as an epistemic, transformative, and educational faculty. A faculty not only capable of generating visions, but also of sustaining, interrogating, and refining them. A power to be reintegrated into our intellectual and civic formation – so that it may help us not only to imagine different worlds, but to understand the conditions that make them possible.</p>
","<p><strong>What are metacognitive skills?</strong><br>In the lexicon of cognitive science and education, “metacognition” refers to that reflective capacity that allows individuals to become aware of their own mental processes, monitor them in real time, evaluate them critically, and, when necessary, modify them.<br><br><em>In essence, it is the ability to “think about one’s own thinking“: to know what one is thinking, how one is processing it, and why.</em><br><br>Though this faculty may at first seem abstract, it plays a crucial role across multiple domains of cognitive life. It enables us to break free from the automatic or unconscious dimensions of mental activity by introducing higher levels of regulation, control, and intentionality. In pedagogy, metacognition has long been recognized as a key enabler of deep learning, self-evaluation, and autonomy in study. When this faculty is extended to the domain of imagination, however, it opens a conceptual horizon that is still largely unexplored – yet extraordinarily rich with potential.<br><br>​In her article “Imagining Imagination: Towards Cognitive and Metacognitive Models,” Helen Burns (2022) explores the intrinsic interrelationship between imagination, cognition, and metacognition, proposing theoretical models that foreground imagination as a core component of thinking and learning. According to Burns, promoting authentic literacy in imagination – understood not as escapism, but as an epistemic practice – requires a deliberate integration of its metacognitive dimension. She argues that the synergy between imagination and metacognition enhances our capacity to learn and contributes to the development of personal and, potentially, democratic awareness.<br><br>From this perspective, to “imagine well” entails being aware of the imaginative act itself – assessing its directions, reconsidering its implications, and potentially reshaping them. It is an invitation not to passively undergo imagination as a spontaneous flow, but to engage it with lucid intentionality, much like one would engage in logical reasoning, storytelling, or design.<br><br><strong>Imagination as a regulated process</strong><br>Imagination, then, should no longer be understood as an uncontrolled mental energy – a centrifugal force of thought—but rather as a process that can be structured, guided, and modulated. Metacognition is pivotal in this regard, offering a reflective scaffolding that enables greater mastery over the content, form, and goals of the imaginative act.<br><br>This hypothesis is empirically supported by the study conducted by Xiaoyu Jia, Weijian Li, Liren Cao (2019), published in Frontiers in Psychology, which demonstrates that individuals with higher metacognitive awareness are more adept at engaging in creative thinking. Not only do they generate a greater number of ideas, but they also exhibit a heightened ability to select those that are most relevant, innovative, and contextually appropriate.<br><br>This finding is essential: it is not enough merely to “be creative.” One must also understand how creativity unfolds, under what mental conditions it thrives, and what strategies promote or inhibit it. Metacognition here becomes an inner compass – a “meta-regulator” of thought – enabling one to monitor the flow of imagination, to distinguish between plausible possibilities and unproductive fantasies, and to direct imagination toward meaningful, relevant, and transformative ends.<br><br>In contexts such as problem-solving, innovation, and strategic planning – central to Foresight and Futures Thinking – this conscious regulation of imagination becomes critically important. It helps avoid both sterile improvisation and aimless speculation, favoring instead a form of design-oriented imagination capable of engaging with the full complexity of reality.<br><br><strong>Imagining as a conscious act</strong><br>Further theoretical insights are offered by Kieron P. O’Connor and Frederick Aardema’s (2003) in their study published in Consciousness and Cognition, where they outline a taxonomy of consciousness levels associated with imagination: precognitive, cognitive, and metacognitive.<br><br>The precognitive level includes automatic sensory and mnemonic processes that generate mental images without deliberate intent.<br><br>The cognitive level encompasses partial awareness of imagination, as seen in daydreaming, divergent thinking, or spontaneous storytelling.<br><br>The metacognitive level represents the highest threshold – where individuals are fully aware of their imaginative acts and exercise reflective control over them.<br><br>From this perspective, imagining is far from a naïve activity. Rather, it is a sophisticated mental operation that can – and should – be exercised deliberately, refined over time, and subjected to critical scrutiny. Metacognitive reflection enhances not only the quality of imagination, but also its coherence, heuristic potential, and contextual relevance.<br><br>This view has significant implications for education and training. To teach people how to imagine—and even more, how to think about imagining – is to introduce them to a dynamic, integrative mode of thinking that is particularly well suited to navigating uncertainty and ambiguity.<br><br><strong>Imagination as an epistemic faculty</strong><br>At this point, the reflection moves beyond the cognitive and practical aspects of imagination and into a broader philosophical terrain: epistemology – the study of the nature, scope, and conditions of knowledge.<br><br>According to Joshua Myers  [The epistemic status of the imagination, 2021], visualization and metacognitive awareness are central to imagination when it is understood as an epistemic faculty – a means of producing knowledge.<br><br>Such a stance demands that we radically reconsider the status of imagination. No longer should it be viewed merely as a supplementary mental activity – useful for generating images, metaphors, or ideas – but rather as a true tool of knowledge, on par with intuition, deduction, or empirical observation.<br><br><em>What does it mean, concretely, to treat imagination as an epistemic faculty?</em><br><br>First, it means recognizing that imagining is not escapism, but a cognitive operation that enables individuals to construct mental models of the possible – to explore what is not yet but could be. Imagination allows us to transcend the constraints of the present, projecting thought into alternative futures, latent hypotheses, or emergent configurations. In this sense, it is both an exploratory function and a heuristic method – a way to question reality from new, potentially generative standpoints.<br><br>Second, when imagination is supported by metacognitive awareness, it becomes a reflective practice. It allows us to test alternatives, simulate consequences, and assess implications. We do not merely fabricate hypothetical worlds; we learn to differentiate between idle speculation and models with internal consistency, plausibility, and epistemic worth. Metacognition, in this light, does not constrain imagination, but hones and directs it – enhancing its capacity to produce insights that, while not always empirically verified, are nonetheless meaningful for understanding and engaging with the world.<br><br>Finally, viewing imagination as epistemic enables us to reassess its role in anticipating, designing, and constructing futures. Exercised with rigor and awareness, imagination not only expands the horizon of possibilities, but reshapes our very perception of reality. It becomes a cognitive medium through which we may challenge what is taken as “given,” “necessary,” or “unchangeable,” and reimagine the present through emerging, still-unformed visions.<br><br>In this way, imagination is not the antithesis of knowledge – as rationalist traditions have long implied – but an integral part of it. It operates in the liminal space between the known and the unknown, between evidence and speculation, between the already thought and the thinkable.<br><br>To recognize imagination as an epistemic faculty is to restore its full philosophical dignity and acknowledge its extraordinary transformative power. It invites us to understand that knowledge does not arise only from observing the world as it is, but also – and perhaps more urgently – from imagining how it might be different. In a time marked by profound discontinuities, systemic crises, and radical transitions, this faculty is not a luxury: it is a cognitive, cultural, and evolutionary imperative.<br><br><strong>From epistemology to practice: metacognitive imagination in Futures Thinking</strong><br>To embrace imagination as an epistemic faculty – as outlined thus far – is to acknowledge its active, conscious role in the production of knowledge, particularly in domains characterized by uncertainty, potentiality, and the not-yet. This recognition finds its most compelling and transformative expression in the field of Futures Thinking and Strategic Foresight.<br><br>Futures Thinking does not aim to predict the future in a deterministic sense. Rather, it seeks to multiply and qualify possibilities. It is a deliberate and structured process that explores future scenarios, tests alternative hypotheses, imagines evolutionary pathways, and evaluates the implications of present decisions.<br><br>Within this framework, imagination is not ornamental, nor merely inspirational. It functions as the central cognitive engine of the process. And when imagination is supported by solid metacognitive awareness – that is, a critical and methodical reflection on how and why we imagine what we imagine – it becomes a powerful tool for strategic design.<br><br><strong>A pedagogy of conscious imagination</strong><br>Training in the metacognition of imagination is not simply a matter of developing creative thinking. Rather, it involves teaching how to think the thinking that imagines: to recognize its patterns, its blind spots, and its potential. It entails cultivating a form of knowledge that inhabits the space between reason and possibility, between what is and what could be.<br><br>Educating the imagination – in its highest sense as a metacognitive and epistemic faculty – is not about encouraging unfocused creativity or celebrating spontaneous flashes of insight. It is something far more profound, demanding, and transformative.<br><br>To train the metacognitive imagination is to guide individuals in critically engaging with their own imaginative processes: questioning not only what they are imagining, but how they are doing so; examining the assumptions that underlie their mental models; exploring the cognitive frameworks they are operating within; identifying the alternatives they have left unexplored; and reflecting on which visions they are privileging – and why.<br><br>This kind of education, still largely unstructured in formal learning environments and even more so in organizational settings, aims to foster a mental posture capable of inhabiting the liminal space between the actual and the possible, between systemic rationality and creative intuition, between what exists and what might – or ought to – exist. It is, in essence, a pedagogy of liminality: one that does not aim to transmit pre-defined knowledge, but rather to prepare minds capable of navigating uncertainty, remaining present in productive ambiguity, and generating new meaning in uncharted territories.<br><br>In today’s complex and turbulent world – marked by multidimensional crises, deep discontinuities, and systemic transitions – this capability emerges as one of the essential competencies of the 21st century. No longer a luxury, but an educational, political, and cultural necessity.<br><br>Teaching people how to imagine consciously is not an abstract intellectual exercise. It is the act of training change-makers: enabling the emergence of citizens, professionals, and leaders who are capable of anticipating the signals of the future, proactively adapting to transformations, and above all, acting with transformative intelligence.<br><br>Such intelligence does not separate thinking from action, but connects them through vision, regulated intuition, and systemic reflection.<br><br><strong>An infrastructure for the future</strong><br>This form of education cannot be confined to schools or academic institutions. It concerns every space in which meaning is produced, decisions are taken, and futures are imagined. Businesses aiming for sustainable innovation, public administrations managing social complexity, communities seeking regeneration, and movements aspiring to transformation – all these domains require a culture of conscious imagination. Not as rhetorical embellishment, but as a foundational cognitive and ethical infrastructure for the future.<br><br>In this sense, a pedagogy of metacognitive imagination is not a standalone discipline to be added to existing curricula or strategies. It is a transversal weave to be integrated across educational, organizational, and civic practices. It is an invitation to cultivate minds that are not only capable of thinking about the future, but also of interrogating the present through the lens of what might otherwise be.</p>

<p>Nobody could really question these broad goals. Nonetheless, it is likely that most people have different associations and inner images when thinking about e.g. climate neutrality, and it is important to seek to clarify what is behind such broad concepts.</p>
<p>Such debates and orientations about sustainability are not new at all. The beginning of the exploration, of what sustainability is, or better said should be, goes back to the late 1980s: from the Brundtland Commission in 1987 and later in 1992 with the Rio conference, sustainability rests on three pillars: a social, environmental and an economic pillar. This very first conceptualisation was, on the one hand, a breakthrough in the global political arena but was later mainly criticised for the missing mutual interactions and the integration of the three pillars. The critique is not entirely fair. The pillars have always been coupled, but often one was given a stronger focus. It was even used to promote the economic paradigm of growth to be in the position to finance social systems and environmental protection. Without going into details at that stage, this decoupled debate was mainly possible by the missing internalisation of external (environmental) costs. Nonetheless, it was the first time that on a global political agenda, it was acknowledged that the immense production and consumption creating waste and pollution and social imbalances globally could not be a model for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most recent conceptualisations by the United Nations uses seventeen sustainability goals (SDG), including economic development, resource efficiency and environmental goals, amongst others. Since adopting these goals, many initiatives have been put in place across the world. However, the goals, especially on a more concrete level, can be conflicting and are partially contradicting each other. For example, SDG 9 promotes industrial production, which might conflict with decreased resource use (SDG 12) and pollution (SDG 15). Depending on how such developments are shaped, also equity and justice are not guaranteed as still, profitability dominates the economic discourse. Such issues are commonly resolved by the argument that priorities are different in different regions of the world and that the concept, therefore, needs to be adapted to regional specificities. Furthermore, even when goals are reached, that does not automatically imply that different countries have taken the same measures and pathways towards the same goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, even with more details on what is meant by “sustainability”, still further clarification can help. The concept can be seen as a plain field to freely manoeuvre: sustainability is the vision, and the planetary boundaries define the corridor in which it can be reached based on different values, cultural heritage and available resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Green Deal is an attempt to further shape sustainability for Europe. But it goes without saying that the goals and ideas are still broad and can be realised completely differently in different regions of Europe. There are twenty-four official languages in Europe and twenty-seven member countries with different cultures and values. Some countries have coastlines, others have no access to the sea at all. Also, population density varies significantly across the different countries. Some countries have a focus on industrial production, others on agricultural production or on IT services. Sustainable solutions must differ across the different European regions. Here the scenarios/imaginaries co-created by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and its country network Eionet kick in as a useful tool to further explore what concrete alternative options for shaping sustainability are.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario-management</strong></p>
<p>Whenever it comes to “thinking in different options”, it is a good starting point to think in scenarios. The term “scenario” originates from the theatre world and literally means the description of the set-up of the stage for a specific scene. The relation to the theatre is useful: the same scene in the same play might look completely different, depending on the art director, the tradition of the theatre, the city and the expected audience. In all cases, one can describe the stage and all items needed for the play. The same applies to the scenarios: the play is “sustainability”, and the items are the different areas that strongly impact it and are highly uncertain. In the terminology of scenario management, these items are the key factors or dimensions. The specific variant of the “item” is called projection. Certainly, there are different techniques for systematically thinking about the future and setting up scenarios. One of these approaches is called “Scenario Management” or “Scenario-Technique” where in the core, a set of relevant key factors is identified, and for each key factor, different (3-5) projections are constructed. These key factors form, together with the projections, a morphological box. A consistent combination of one projection per key factor forms the skeleton for one scenario.</p>
<p>This kind of scenario management technique has been applied in the project “Scenarios for a sustainable Europe in 2050” by the EEA and the Eionet. Based on the normative concept of sustainability – as framed in the Green Deal – a set of influencing factors was first collected in a participatory process along with the STEEP categories (Social, Technological, Environmental, Economical and Political). Factors like “values, lifestyles, attitudes towards sustainability”, “Production and consumption of energy”, “Role of technology”, or “Pattern of European cooperation” have been selected, next to others. These key factors define the skeleton of the narrative of how sustainability can be shaped in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The four imaginaries of the European Environment Agency and the Eionet</strong></p>
<p>The four imaginaries are called: “Technocracy for the common good”, “Ecotopia”, “The great decoupling”, and “Unity in adversity.</p>
<p>The detailed descriptions of the imaginaries can be found on the webpage of the EEA: <a href=""https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/scenarios-for-a-sustainable-europe-2050/the-scenarios"" target=""_blank"">link</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All scenarios carry elements that are visible already today. In addition, these scenarios are normative in the sense that only sustainable solutions are covered in the key factors and projections. The bandwidth of different developments in the scenarios is not that wide or extreme. It is striking that these imaginaries also represent different current discourses in Europe, which makes this kind of assessment especially rich. The imaginary “Technocracy for the common good” advocates technological innovation as the key solution to a sustainable development in Europe. In contrast, “Ecotopia” promotes a “back to nature and communitarian” solution. The imaginary “The great decoupling” focuses on a neo-liberal path toward solving all challenges economically, while the imaginary “Unity in adversity” suggests a strong top-down EU policy as the central key to sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, tensions and possibly conflicting objectives between the different solutions and certain protagonists lead the public debate. The imaginaries do not resolve the conflicting goals but allow to make these different discourses visible and accessible for an informed political debate.</p>
<p>How could R&amp;I make use of such kinds of scenarios or imaginaries? Should all discourses be supported or followed by in the research programmes? Who are the prominent actors in the field having an interest in one or the other solution? Which role does the subsidiary principle play? How much freedom and independence are needed for shaping sustainability effectively in the different regions of Europe? How must this be reflected in the Research Programmes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine us starting to cross-link the discourses to some domains in R&amp;I. For example, how would R&amp;I be shaped within the different discourses?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
","<p>This table is not a completed research project but illustrates in simple a way how a different discourse might shape the orientation of the research agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In such a sense, the imaginaries of the EEA and the Eionet are useful tools to support the political exchange and reconsider R&amp;I policy. We can assume that there are different solutions to a sustainable Europe. Which is (where?) the most effective? How fast do we need to transform? What are the most urgent topics and issues to resolve? Is transformation always the solution to the problems? Shall we be prepared for the less attractive transformations? And how?</p>
<p>Scenarios like those from the EEA and the Eionet do not deliver all the answers. But they help to concretise abstract concepts like “Sustainability”. And such scenarios help to facilitate a debate about what we as a society want. Interestingly, current discourses are all well reflected in such scenarios, and while the tone of the protagonists of the discourses might be harsh on social media, with the help of such scenarios, the options and viewpoints can stand next to each other, and the discussions get a different characteristic.</p>
<p>How would YOU like to shape sustainability for and in Europe? And what are the most important research topics?</p>
<p>Let's exchange on the future of Europe.</p>

Multi-country foresight (McF) shall be designed and used to analyse future-oriented common issues and goals, detect opportunities for cooperation and eventual conflicts of interest, identify complementary attributes, and promote supra-national or global facilities, infrastructures and services. Attention is given to participation mechanisms, allowing the implementation of common visions of the future by joining efforts, knowledge stocks, economic and political strengths, and improving international collaboration, strategic alliances and networking. The concept addresses two main development vectors: science, technology and innovation (STI) systems and productive chains. The core idea here is to use the foresight process as a tool for establishing multi-country STI policies and programs as well as policies and strategies for promoting global productive chains.

As a federal enterprise working in the fields of international cooperation for sustainable development and international education, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH is strongly affected by the political and economic environment in which it operates. This is why it is important for GIZ to understand the underlying drivers of change and possible future developments so that it can prepare for the future and the challenges it will face, ultimately making the organization and its staff more resilient.<br><br>With its broad network of staff and international experts in over 120 partner countries, GIZ is well equipped to monitor and differentiate relevant signals and developments.  At headquarters, a dedicated foresight team addresses future issues at a corporate level and contributes to the company's strategic decision-making.<br><br><strong><ins>GIZ’ foresight report 2024</ins></strong><br><br>Sustainable development is GIZ’s core business. The 2030 Agenda provides the framework for GIZ’s global activities. As the year 2030 is getting closer, the question is: will the negotiations on a new agenda be successful? But one thing is clear: any negotiation process and subsequent implementation will be increasingly shaped by geopolitical factors. This is why, the 2024 foresight report of GIZ, focuses on geopolitics, sustainable development and the global agenda for the next decade.<br><br>In total, the views of more than 100 GIZ colleagues from GIZ's HQ and the field structure were incorporated into the report through various workshops. In addition, the report is based on extensive analysis of secondary sources, and interviews with more than 30 experts from various (international) institutions to ensure that the report also reflects perspectives from outside GIZ.      <br><br>The scenarios (<em>strongly condensed for this post</em>) are based on the four archetypes of the Manoa School of Futures Studies and Jim Dator, which represent four recurring paths of human civilization found in all cultures. Each scenario is supplemented by two to three short wildcards, some of which are listed here as examples.</p>
","<p><strong>Growth scenario: Clinging to the growth paradigm in a bloc confrontation  </strong>  <br>The intensifying struggle for hegemony between China and the US is increasingly forcing the countries of the Global South to choose sides in the bipolar global order. In the late 2020s, the bloc confrontation accelerates the growing divergence between the goals of green transformation and securing continued economic growth. Under China's leadership, the BRICS+ countries launch their own global development agenda. The G7 responds with a counter-agenda that emphasizes the importance of democratic rights.   <br><em>Wildcard example “Billionaires with God complex”: a small group of super-rich individuals plan to reverse climate change through geoengineering, ignoring the incalculable risks.</em><br><br><strong>Collapse scenario: Global disorder – Looking into the abyss</strong><br>In many parts of the world, the early 2030s are marked by fragility, conflicts over borders and resource distribution. The US retreats into isolationism and the conflict with China over Taiwan is escalating. Acute loss of prosperity in the Global North and a state of socioeconomic emergency in the Global South outweigh long-term challenges, including climate change and dramatically worsening inequalities. Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling worldwide disinformation campaigns. In the wake of blockades of fundamental UN transformations in the late 2020s, the 2030 Agenda is abandoned.<br><em>Wildcard example “Ode to joy ”: External pressure accelerates the European integration and forges a new identity for the EU as a global geopolitical actor.</em><br><br><strong>Discipline scenario: Fragile balance of power and the limits of growth</strong><br>The early 2030s are marked by a fragile balance of power and a growing recognition of the limits to growth. The systemic rivalry between China and the West has eased in the meantime. Many emerging economies in the Global South continue to close the economic gap with the Global North, but progress is slowing. Higher carbon prices and tighter government regulation, particularly in Europe, are helping to reduce emissions, but not yet at the pace and scale needed. UN member states take the path of least resistance and agree to extend the 2030 Agenda until 2045.<br><em>Wildcard example: “China’s economy implodes”: With far-reaching implications for global supply chains and international power dynamics. </em><br><br><strong>Transformation scenario: New global agenda and multilateral cooperation</strong><br>The global consequences of climate change have led to a veritable cascade of extreme weather events, forcing the global community to rethink international cooperation and climate change efforts. The old global power dynamics have given way to an institution-based multipolar system. China is opening up and is acting as a global driver for renewable energies. Consequently, a new global agenda is adopted in 2030. The new agenda is based on a new understanding that reflects different cultural narratives, values and identities. AI-based innovations are paving the way for sustainable development, and circular economy. <br><em>Wildcard example “AI goes rogue”: Within a very short time, all AI-driven systems fail, bringing infrastructure and communications to a standstill in most states.</em><br><br><strong><ins>From scenarios to management response</ins></strong><br><br>The scenarios shed new light on the current situation, existing strategies, and (often linear or subconscious) assumptions about the future, enabling GIZ to identify potential opportunities and risks at an early stage and consider these in the interest of our partners and commissioning parties. However, moving from scenarios to action requires an additional step. At GIZ, the foresight team seeks to answer four key strategic questions for each scenario: What plausible changes might occur over the next ten years regarding <em>1) GIZ’s client base, 2) partner countries, 3) the topics of development cooperation, and 4) the competitive and cooperative landscape</em>? These questions help derive concrete implications from the scenarios, identify action corridors, and support decision-making.<br><br>For the first time, the 2024 foresight report also presents ten deliberately provocative theses on the future of GIZ, identifying specific areas for the organization’s further development. The aim is to provide food for thought on the next steps and to encourage an in-depth analysis of GIZ’s future.<br><br>To maximize impact, the report was shared at a company-wide launch event and via short videos in internal company news. These rather passive formats were particularly effective in raising awareness of foresight and futures thinking. But even more importantly, it has triggered a wave of requests for tailored input sessions and workshops. As a result, the foresight team engaged with more than 50 organizational units and management teams over nine months in intense deliberations about how to make GIZ a more future-ready organization. The most effective formats went beyond merely discussing  the report; they involved jointly exploring scenarios and their implications for the respective work units. Methods such as the Futures Wheel, Windtunneling, Pre-Mortem, and Three Horizons were used. Additionally, the provocative ten theses proved to be a valuable tool for initiating action-oriented dialogue across units. Overall, the report and the various activities reached more than a quarter of the entire workforce. Insights from the report are also actively fed into company-wide strategic processes, including long-term corporate planning, corporate communication, and innovation management.<br><br>At GIZ, we see great value in connecting with other organizations and foresight units to strengthen our approaches and shape more resilient, future-ready organizations together.  Sharing insights on key learnings, challenges, and good practices with external partners can help refine strategic foresight and navigate common pitfalls. GIZ’s external network was particularly helpful in critically reflecting on the findings of the foresight report and learning from the experiences of other organizations. A meaningful exchange that we are eager to continue – and we actively invite new partners to join the conversation.</p>

","<p>Europe is facing major societal challenges (climate change, demographic trends, cultural shifts induced by technology, new geopolitical balances, among others), which are radically changing the landscape of the European Union. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the instability of the markets and the economy and the difficulties of national and European public administrations in responding to the priorities of the citizens, have contributed to the increased detachment and lack of trust among citizens. While this poses risks to the<br>formal structures and institutions traditionally framing and holding together the European social system based on democracy and the free market, the EU is pursuing major transition programmes in order to respond to the major societal challenges. Its concerns with resilience extend to both, the structures and institutions that hold Europe together, and to the transition programmes that it wishes to drive.</p>
<p>We consider <strong>civic resilience, as the ability of a community, city, or society to prepare for, respond to, recover from, and adapt to adversities, challenges, or disruptions</strong>. Civic resilience is a core concern in crises as well as in transitions. It is about civil society surviving changes (disruptions, tipping points, crises etc. whether they are abrupt or founded in long-term developments). It calls for local commitment, preparedness beyond the support of the public administration and the private sector. It´s about civil society, both the community (social organizations) and the individuals (citizens), taking the initiative – as a key actor framing any social system –<br>to lead social change.</p>
<p><strong>Exploring alternative futures addressing radical changes in society can help better prepare for future crises and strengthen the resilience of civil society today. Therefore, in this policy brief, we aim to assist policymakers by devising four possible future scenarios in 2040 and by considering their implications for today.</strong> While the challenges considered are global, policy implications are addressed especially about the European research and innovation policy. Four alternative scenarios were identified around two main axes (technological and economic adaptation and social &amp; environmental stewardship):</p>
<ul>
<li>The first scenario, where both techno-economic adaptation and socio-environmental stewardship are high, represents an ideal future. This scenario (best of worlds) would be featured by low levels of community and individual resilience (welfare annihilates survival instinct): civil society would not be ready to face an unexpected event, totally devoid of self-protection mechanisms.</li>
<li>The second scenario, where techno-economic adaptation is low but socio-environmental stewardship is high, means institutional void but strong community consensus. Here the risk -in terms of civic resilience- is that if the community prevails totally, then individuality is cancelled. Citizens are subordinated to the collective, which means the coexistence of a high level of community resilience and a low level of individual resilience.</li>
<li>The third scenario, where high techno-economic adaptation meets low soc-environmental stewardship, represents a risk of rupture in the social fabric due to ubiquity and omnipresence of technology (AI, Singularity, Transhumanism?), an anomic society where community resilience is low -or even maybe annulled- even individual resilience may be high: in a homogenised alienated society<br>where social institutions are annulled the only possible resistance may come from the individuals (a minority).</li>
<li>The fourth scenario, the worst-case one, represents the survival mode where the menace is extreme, total and constant. Low techno-economic adaptation meets low socio-environmental stewardship, producing a vicious circle of desolation characterized by the fact that the social fabric is broken. It would be a radical context where both community and individual resilience may be high because<br>hostile environments reinforce survival instinct (both individual and collective)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each scenario provides a different point of view towards the situation in the EU today and what could and should be done by EU R&amp;I policy, and by related policy fields that will affect the efficacy of the R&amp;I policy pursuits towards civic resilience. <br><br></p>

To reach such a mass market, a low-cost clean-hydrogen supply must be available. However, to lower the price of hydrogen, much larger H2-markets and volumes are needed. The scale and the cost (of green hydrogen) go hand in hand. But they also form a classical Chicken and Egg problem, which many now successful clean energy technologies have likewise faced in the past and managed to overcome.</p>","<p>What can we learn from the past to accelerate green-hydrogen development? In simple terms, the technology and the hydrogen market must be addressed simultaneously. This can be achieved through a range of ‘technology push and market pull’ actions, for example, increasing research, development, and innovation efforts (RDI) to improve the technology base and reduce its costs. Or, providing financial support to investments of full-scale pilot plants and demonstrations which will increase the volume up-take of the technology and will lead to important learning-by-doing or learning-by-using endogenous learning effects that further reduce the cost of technology. Empirically, we know that for each doubling of the cumulative volume produced, the unit cost may drop by 15 per cent.</p>
<p>Naturally, if the technology were still too immature such as in the case of fusion energy, technology-push would be preferred as it would not make sense to start massive industrial efforts yet. For solar photovoltaics (PV), the German feed-in-tariffs opened the market for PV and, together with the Chinese scale-up of industrial production of solar cells, helped photovoltaics to reach a global breakthrough leading to 90 per cent lower prices in just a decade. The same story repeats itself now with batteries and electric vehicles, where the decreasing cost of batteries has been even more fierce than with PV.</p>
<p>Could such a development be possible for green hydrogen as well? Green hydrogen is still 2-4 times costlier than traditional fossil-fuel-based hydrogen and is not competitive to form a replacement. A target price of around €2/kgH2 could ensure competitiveness in many applications. However, that cost target is not that far off as a 50-60% drop from the present cost level of producing green-H2 would be required. From a historical perspective, compared to other successful clean energy technologies, it is now the right moment to gear up the efforts to commercialize and scaling-up green hydrogen. The transition is already passing the point where combining stronger push-and-pull measures are justified. Even shifting more towards the market-pull would be motivated as that would create the industrial base for the massive scale-up and economy-of-scale-driven price reduction required for green hydrogen to reach the energy-relevant level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The markets are now clearly starting to pull hydrogen into a larger scale, often helped by the support from national governments. A recent report by McKinsey (2022) shows that some 680 large-scale hydrogen projects have been announced globally, reaffirming the intent to make hydrogen viable for large-scale use (Fig. 1). These projects importantly span the whole supply-chain from production, transport, use to the infrastructure of hydrogen, which supports creating the necessary ecosystems for massive use of hydrogen. Europe has a lead in this development as almost half of the large-scale hydrogen projects are located here, and the EU shows the way forward in several areas, such as using green-hydrogen for steelmaking. The European Union hydrogen strategy, which explores renewable hydrogen to help cost-effectively decarbonize the EU, has played a pivotal role in this development by creating a concerted European action toward scale-up of production and infrastructure for hydrogen. If successful, the global push of emission-free hydrogen could help to cut even up to 20 per cent of the global CO2 emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>Figure 1. Large-scale hydrogen projects globally. (Source: Bernd Heid, Alma Sator, Maurits Waardenburg, and Markus Wilthaner (2022). Five charts on hydrogen’s role in a net-zero future. McKinsey Sustainability)</p>
<p>Though the market-pull signals for green-hydrogen are very encouraging, the technology-push will still be highly useful and even necessary to reduce the costs and in helping to ‘root’ and integrate hydrogen into energy systems. One key area in this context will be reducing the cost of green-hydrogen production through electrolysis, which is influenced the investment (capex) and the running costs (opex), in particular the price of electricity and efficiency of the H2 system. By 2030, the specific cost of both alkaline and PEM electrolysis could be halved to below €500 per kW through technological advancements, an increase in manufacturing volumes and scaling up to 100 MW-units (source: Cost forecast for low-temperature electrolysis – technology driven bottom-up prognosis for PEM and alkaline water electrolysis systems. Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, October 2021).</p>
<p>Combining the above technological achievements within reach with better systems operation, in particular increasing the operation time of hydrogen production plants to at least 40% of full load hours and feeding electrolysis with cheap renewable electricity, could lead to a complete cost breakthrough of green-hydrogen, i.e., meeting the perhaps most crucial prerequisite for full scale-up. Integration of hydrogen production into the energy systems offers further benefits which should neither be overlooked. Production of H2 and its derivates (e.g., synthetic fuels) involves side-products such as heat and oxygen, which create value. For example, a full-scale power-to-gas plant using hydrogen to be built in Vantaa city close to Helsinki, Finland, will integrate a whole hydrogen system into the municipal energy system. The waste heat created will be utilised, thus increasing the hydrogen system's overall energy efficiency to 90 per cent.</p>
<p>Technology-push-actions should also address important strategic future issues that could either accelerate or hamper green-hydrogen uptake and scale-up in the long term. Such questions include e.g., the availability of critical materials needed in hydrogen technologies, storage of hydrogen in large-scale, safe use of H2 in civic society, etc. Many of these technology-related questions have been under research and development for several decades. Still, these should now be addressed through adequate RDI resources and coordinated efforts to find satisfactory solutions yet to be developed. Bridging science to innovations will be of utmost importance to feed next-generation solutions and (more effective and cheaper) technologies necessary for the next steps in scaling up.</p>
<p>Hydrogen has remained as a vision for half a century from the times of the oil-crises, when it was first identified as a potential mover-and-shaker technology in energy. Hydrogen has undergone many hypes in the past. But this time, turning the promise of green hydrogen into one of the solutions to the climate-energy nexus is closer to reality than ever because scaling matters here, and we now have a more credible pathway for scaling up green hydrogen.</p>

<p><strong><em>A proposal for a methodology to identify Megatrends and Grand societal challenges with a significance for Research and Innovation in the Czech Republic</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2021, <strong>we designed and implemented a methodology for identifying Megatrends and Grand societal challenges with a significance for the Czech Republic.</strong> This work was carried out via a research grant from the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TA ČR). The final users included the Government Office of the Czech Republic with the aim to update Research and Innovation priorities in applied research as well as the Ministry of Industry and Trade, who is responsible for implementing the Regional Innovation Strategy (RIS3). The foresight process combined <strong>desk-research, workshops and a Delphi survey </strong>to select and prioritise relevant Megatrends and Grand societal challenges.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the project, <strong>a desk-research was carried on stocktaking information from foresight reports produced by various authoritative organisations.</strong> These included international organisations (e.g. EU, OECD, NATO), national reports (e.g. Finnish Government report on the Future, USA Global Trends Report), businesses (e.g. consultancy companies, insurances) and non-profit organisations (e.g. Oxfam, The Millennium Project). See the final report for the whole list of sources used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These insights about Megatrends and related societal challenges were<strong> summarised into 18 cards </strong>covering a broad spectrum of topics along the STEEP framework:</p>
","<p><strong>Each card was then reviewed and discussed by a large panel of domain experts</strong> during a World café workshop as well as through individual consultations. Approximately 100 experts participated in these consultations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final version of <strong>the 18 cards was then distributed to 25 Delphi participants</strong>, <strong>who assessed their relevance</strong> for Research and Innovation priorities in the Czech Republic based on three criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>""The area will have a very significant impact on the quality of life in Czechia in the next decades.""</li>
<li>""Public funding should be preferentially allocated to understanding it and addressing it.""</li>
<li>""Czech Republic should preferentially allocate public funding for this area compared to the other areas to support research, development and innovation in social sciences, humanities and arts.""</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, <strong>experts were tasked to reflect </strong>on the most significant societal challenges that stem from the implications of Megatrends.</p>
<p>To provide further information to the Delphi experts, we conducted <strong>two public consultations</strong>. One in the form of a forecasting tournament, where participants were tasked with forecasting the results of the Delphi survey. The second via a one-off questionnaire to young researchers participating in the Zeta program of the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The results of the Delphi survey clearly outline a cluster of significant areas that should be prioritised in Research and Innovation policy. These include <strong>Education and Employment, Digitisation, AI and automation, Environment, Democracy and Governance, Science and Innovation, Values, Poverty and Inequalities and Health</strong>. See the graph below for the full results of the Delphi survey.</p>

Rooted in different narratives represented by different social groups they are often competing for the sovereignty of interpretation of what a particular future may look like and how we are to achieve it. Social confrontations are not a singular phenomenon; instead, we live in a world of multiple social confrontations, and they co-exist, overlap, and compete. The divides social confrontations create can go across all spheres of life: education, care, health, nutrition, energy, mobility, communication, race, gender, political power, migration, etc. This blog post explores how these developments are likely to impact the futures of democracy in Europe. To this end, we present four scenarios that chart diverging pathways on how social confrontations could evolve in the next 15 years under various drivers and trends and what role they could play for the democratic development in the EU. The four scenarios discuss various development paths - they are intended to explore diver-gent possibilities and do not always depict a preferable future. </p>","<p><em>Our scenarios are part of the deep dive ""Social Confrontations"" under the ""European R&amp;I foresight and public engagement for Horizon Europe"" project.</em> <br><br>In <strong>“A Resilient and Consensual European Confederation“</strong> social confrontations take bifurcations in many directions and social spheres and become an important element of political and institutional reform. Civil society participates in many social groups to claim more influence in policy making, seeking new forms of structured dialogue with different stakeholder groups, new forms of reconciliation, and critical reflection, and thus contributes to social transformation. Among those reformed EU institutions are the European Parliament and the European Citizens’ Assembly. The latter consists of a wide and inclusive popular parliament selected through sortition. Both, parliament and assembly, concentrate most of the decision-making power. Hence, by 2040, the transformation of the EU into a confederation close to the model of post-national constellation is almost complete and reflects the Europeans’ renewed trust in democracy to enhance the prosperity and well-being of the citizens. As virtually all types of claims raised by the Europeans reach consent-oriented policymaking and decision-making levels thanks to the renewed and reinforced petitioning, participatory, deliberative, and direct democracy mechanisms, their inclination to protest against the institutional systems and the political collective leadership is by far less prominent as in the past. Internet platforms play an important part for the exchange of opinion and for developing innovative solutions to societal problems. A crucial factor for the mediating role of such tools is that they are regulated in terms of size and controlled in terms of content. Regulations stem also from participatory discussions and consent making approaches.<br><br> <strong>“European Democracy defends itself against totalitarian tendencies“ </strong>is a scenario where right-wing extremists openly and covert try to take over democratic forces in the EU and to dissolve major democratic institutions of the EU. Several Member States have left the EU or were expelled due to diverging views on liberal rights of citizens and compliance with the Human Rights Charta. In the illiberal states, social media are controlled by the government, propagating conformity and exclusion of non-conformist attitudes and behaviour. This raises a lot of concerns of minority groups who take to the streets to protest for their interests. Even the still liberal European democracies are shaken by social confrontations as well – stemming from all sorts of diverging interests. Some social protest groups use violent methods to point to the fact that climate change is the most severe threat for humans and their environment. Some groups protest peacefully. Other groups sabotage the infrastructure that is crucial for individual transport. The ideologies and means of the very extreme or even radical right- and left-wing groups cannot be reconciled it seems. However, some countries have made very positive experiences in finding solution, mediating opposite social groups on single issues. New forms of participation and experiments further developed the setup of citizen councils, for example, to solve privacy of data, taxation of millionaires, integration of migrants, unconditional basic income, location of new power plants etc. Through complex but transparent procedures that involved a large scale of citizens representative of the individual country or region with guidance of professional facilitators acceptable solutions could be found that subsequently were implemented by policymakers and eliminated at least some issues of social confrontations. Despite this progress, it is hard to build bridges in order to overcome the genuine cleavages and eradicate the roots of social confrontations.<br><br> The context of the <strong>“European Fortress” </strong>scenario is that after a long period of poly-crises, the EU is turned in towards itself and has decided to adopt a defensive position. The EU is defending its bordersagainst all sorts of external attempts of infiltration, undermining of its sovereignty directly as well as indirectly, including subversive attacks from foreign troll armies. The defensive position is also taking measures against migration from outside Europe. The nationalist narrative of right-wing parties has been replaced by a European supra-national narrative. The engineering of a ""national"" European identity is facilitated by the continuing threats from outside. This new “national” social populism has become a hallmark of far-right parties. On the one hand, the predominantly right-wing to centrist governments are implementing a strict almost-zero-migration regime at the EU’s external borders supported by high-tech surveillance, without shying away from armed violence. In the last 20 years, there has been an increase in social fragmentation that has greatly challenged society as a whole. However, no group has been able to gain real dominance. Overall, the EU remained a diverse society with local togetherness and, in some cases, tolerated coexistence with cautious self-governing structures for very heterogeneous social groupings. To ensure public peace, many community centres, and other public spaces where individuals meet and engage in dialogue have been established to improve living together. Relatively high transfer payments as well as an indexed basic income and a relatively relaxed housing market contribute to an elastic society that looks for balance and aims to absorb social confrontations at the local level.<br>The soul of Europe is a frozen melting pot that wants to become highly self-sufficient economically, politically, and militarily and to emancipate and separate itself from the rest of the world. Significant investments are made in military armament, technology development, and education and training programmes to promote European cultural sensitivity and European identity.<br><br> In the last scenario,<strong>“Cultural hegemony through global capitalism” </strong>almost all social confrontation has ended. A few multinational tech companies have taken over the control of all communication around the globe and have designed autonomous algorithm that are optimising the digital technologies in order to infiltrate people toward more consumption and less social protest. Instead of the gruesome reality where climate change increases along with deprivation and destruction, individualized bubbles of social media keep up the illusion of a rosy world where all material and ideological longing can be satisfied by consumption and the accumulation of more wealth. Products are tailored, each person experiences what the platforms make them believe they need. Social movements and protest groups have been replaced by fun and pop culture of consumption whereas legal status for minorities has not improved. Community building for political purposes is quasi non-existent. The tech companies cooperate with the governments as both are looking for driving economic growth for their own benefits. Accordingly, the political-industrial complex releases misinformation to manipulate the people to align to the official policies. EU laws do not have the power to contain them, or policy makers do not have an interest to take actions. Opposing voices do not have any chance to be heard or spread, except through hacks. The illusionary peacefulness in the EU Member States is occasionally distorted by foreign (mis)information. Hacked social media channels spread the information of the division of worlds, waging distrust between different social groups that have found their niches of social identity within the various sections of the tech platforms. It is hard to tell for the average media user and consumer what information is true or not. There is worrisome information about climate change incidents in various parts of the world, about power abuse, the media elite and new technologies that can either solve all problems or cause new ones. Some countries in the global south that perceive themselves as underprivileged, now have the possibility to develop nuclear weapons and blackmail the global north. Some of these countries demand more participation in the capitalist production pattern via transfer payments, while others want Western companies and institutions out of their countries and use the scarce resources on their own.</p>

The project ‘After the new normal: Scenarios for Europe in the post Covid-19 world’ examined possible futures of 2040 for the EU emerging from the crisis of the pandemic, as possible contexts for EU R&amp;I. The five scenarios described in this report chart different possible post-Covid-19 evolution paths, creating new perspectives on key EU R&amp;I policy issues.</p>
<p><strong>Control over technological development</strong></p>
<p>Across all scenarios, the ability of the European Union to exert control over future technological development - through regulation, standardisation, and the enforcement of policy - entails wide ranging socio-economic implications for the broader society.</p>
<p>The EU share of global R&amp;D is shrinking, and there is an unavoidable, growing EU dependence on technologies developed and produced elsewhere in the world, most notably in the US or China. There is also an ever-increasing influence of private firms on technological development, including large multinationals, which remain largely outside public control as regards potential societal consequences of the deployment of those technologies. The challenges these trends may pose to the ability of the EU to exercise control over technological development will depend on the speed of the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and on the character of the relationships that will be built during the recovery effort.</p>
<p><strong>Resilience, adaptability and preparedness for future crises</strong></p>
<p>Resilience, adaptability and preparedness require an anticipatory R&amp;I policy including ways of identifying, monitoring and addressing threats and developing new emergency response capacities that involve science in systemic roles: as a generator of advice, as a capacity for quick analysis, monitoring of the challenge and evaluating the efficacy of responses, as well as a generator of new responses and tools against the crisis. Preparedness should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Wind-tunnelling’ new plans, policies, and institutions through worst-case scenarios for alternative crises.</li>
<li>Exploring regularly new modes of assessing threats and trialing emergency responses, which offer the possibility to explore hidden opportunities.</li>
<li>Engaging research with all branches of government to share findings about threats and opportunities, and to foster more integrated and coordinated responses.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The key role of education</strong></p>
<p>The Covid-19 crisis precipitates the introduction of a new wave of educational technologies, opening up new possibilities and engendering new challenges and risks. This could be heralding new opportunities for improving the relations<br>between science and education, and therefore strengthening the contributions of science to society, as well as new challenges of fracturing value and belief systems, populism and fake news. The availability of public funds for education and the role that private companies will play in new educational developments will be critical. EU R&amp;I policy can contribute to improving the links between science, technology and education by supporting local experimentation in education in a framework that could help diffuse good practices across the EU.</p>
<p><strong>EU level financing for R&amp;I</strong></p>
<p>After nearly 50 years of Framework Programme, EU direct funding for R&amp;I projects has become part of the institutional backbone of the EU. The scenarios remind us that this is not given and that the EU budget is subject to political negotiations despite its importance for the maintenance of R&amp;I capacity in different Member States. There is a continuous need for ensuring that the EU gets value for money out of its investments in R&amp;I including the recognition of the benefit that Member States and EU policies across the board gain from the EU Framework Programme.</p>
<p><strong>Regional disparities in R&amp;I performance</strong></p>
<p>The persistence of regional disparities in R&amp;I performance has been a problem for the EU for a long time, and one that the EU has yet to resolve. The scenarios remind us that such disparities can develop into deep divide across the economy and politics of the European Union. Furthermore, the scenarios demonstrate how some modes of recovery can be better suited for enabling the more equitable generation of economic and social value from R&amp;I, particularly in those regions facing greater present day challenges. Emphasis in social innovation, social entrepreneurship and frugal innovation in the EU instruments may make important contributions to overcoming regional disparities.</p>
<p><strong>Defining future priorities in R&amp;I policy</strong></p>
<p>R&amp;I policy priority-setting processes and the extent to which R&amp;I priorities are driven by concerns with the past, current and future challenges vary across Member States of the EU. This affects the definiton of joint priorities as well as the diversity and vibrancy of the EU innovation ecosystem. Scenarios that explored conditions of challenging polarisation between different national interests and between public and private interests, highlight the importance of public engagement and especially of engagement with new actors, such as social-purpose companies, in the definition of future priorities of EU R&amp;I policy as well as in the governance and implementation of the R&amp;I effort.</p>
<p><strong>Other emerging issues of relevance to EU R&amp;I policy</strong></p>
<p>Additional emerging issues that may deserve particular attention in the coming years include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several scenarios suggest that there will be both a greater need and stronger willingness for Member States to collaborate closely on matters of R&amp;I policy.</li>
<li>The widening of the range of actors as well as of policies that matter for R&amp;I, linked to the growing policy attention to system change will become an important challenge for coordination of efforts and policy coherence.</li>
<li>With their strong emphasis on competitiveness and growth objectives, the established rationales underpinning EU R&amp;I policy are increasingly out of synch with the needs of societal and world challenges.</li>
<li>As the landscape of European knowledge systems continues to evolve, R&amp;I policy must realise its influential role in shaping broader change and adopt socio-economic disparities and environmental concerns as guiding principles.</li>

<p>All scenarios suggest the need for stepping up collective capability and willingness to actively engage in open and collaborative R&amp;I relationships, both within Europe and with the world beyond Europe. This is obvious in relation to some of the global challenges Europe is aiming to address, but also with regard to emerging technologies where international alliances are decisive for establishing common standards and regulation. In order to ensure a relevant global role of Europe in the world, it is essential to build upon a strong, stable and coherent home base in R&amp;I.</p>

With this focus, the study presents strategic areas of intervention covering a new social contract, governance for sustainability, people and economy, and the global perspective on sustainability. The study reflects on the agency of EU actors (such as government at various levels, business, and communities) to address the strategic areas of intervention as part of collectively addressing sustainability transitions. The study builds on a participatory foresight exercise, which generated four foresight scenarios for a climate-neutral EU in 2050. Based on each scenario, a corresponding transition pathway was co-created and analysed through the process. The study presents and analyses these outputs of the process. The outputs can also serve as input to policymakers and practitioners interested in conducting new participatory exercises on sustainability transitions.</p>

The event was organized within the framework of the EU-funded project Eye of Europe, which aims to strengthen the integration of foresight methods into European research and innovation (R&amp;I) policy-making.<br>The workshop’s objective was to analyze the societal impacts and potential of assistive technologies for aging, from both demographic and technological innovation perspectives. It particularly focused on the relevance of AALT for future policy strategies across the European Research Area (ERA).<br>23 international experts from academia, policy, civil society, social care, engineering, and business took part in the event. Two keynote contributions from the fields of technology foresight (Dr. Simone Ehrenberg-Silies, VDI/VDE-IT) and smart health (Christian Gräff, Smart Health Living Center Berlin) set the stage. Participants then applied the “Futures Wheel” foresight method to systematically map direct and indirect effects of technological developments in the AALT field.<br>The Futures Wheel proved to be a highly effective tool for visualizing complex cause-and-effect relationships under uncertainty and initiating future-oriented planning processes. The workshop offered an interdisciplinary platform for exchange, discussion, and strategic foresight.<br>The program was complemented by an informal pre-event on May 19, which included a visit to the Futurium museum and a joint dinner at a traditional Berlin restaurant.</p>

The need to think about the longer-term and how to build our collective resilience to deal with shocks and unforeseeable threats - to be able to 'stay the course' - has rarely been more pressing.<br><br>The speakers at this 12th annual ESPAS Conference will aim to<strong> shed light on some of the fundamental challenges Europe will face in the fields of technology, geopolitics, democracy and intergenerational fairness</strong>. And together we will <strong>explore possible scenarios for charting a course towards 2040</strong>. How can the European Union harness transformative technologies such as AI? Where should it position itself in a new world order, and how can we shape it? How can European democracy be revitalised and societies respond to creeping authoritarianism? How can we build a new intergenerational fairness agenda?<br><br>These and other epoch-defining challenges decision-makers face cannot simply be overcome using short-term fixes. Politicians are increasingly looking for anticipatory, longer-term thinking that offers them pathways to improved policy outcomes. <strong>Foresight, with its inherent ability to harness collective intelligence and promote long-term thinking, plays an increasingly important role in supporting European policy-makers to make the right strategic choices.</strong><br><br>Our aim in ESPAS is to help European Union policy-makers prepare better for the shocks and opportunities that come our way, but also to offer a structured approach with practical tools to look beyond today's challenges. This annual ESPAS conference with leading political figures, civil society representatives, policy experts and foresight practitioners offers a unique platform to bring foresight and policy-making together in a European context. It also provides a significant and timely opportunity to explore new ideas for Europe's future, and to help shape its priorities for the coming decades.<br><br>👉<a href=""https://www.espas.eu/programme2025.html"" target=""_blank""><strong> See the programme</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>

Fostering collaborations between the scientific community and policymakers by using a future-oriented mindset.</p>
","<p><strong>The </strong><a href=""https://www.un.org/bbnjagreement/en"" target=""_blank""><strong>agreement</strong></a><strong>  made by the UN member states on the 5th of March on the protection of marine biodiversity in international waters signals the increasing importance of biodiversity preservation on the international political agenda. </strong>It stresses the urgent need to conserve and sustainably use the Earth’s biodiversity, considering the rapid extinction rates around the world’s most important nature sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took more than 10 years of negotiations to reach this agreement, which highlights the complexity of balancing competing interests among different countries and stakeholders to address the concerns arising from scientific evidence. The European Union is also taking steps to tackle these challenges and develop effective measures for biodiversity preservation, such as for example through the Green Deal. <br>Additionally, the EU’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme includes several initiatives aiming at research for the protection and preservation of biodiversity, including the 21 BiodivScen research projects funded by the BiodivERsA network, the predecessor of the European Biodiversity Partnership (Biodiversa+), jointly with the Belmont Forum. BiodivScen is one example of a programme that uses scenario-making as a core component of its research. The programme aims to develop and evaluate scenarios of future changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services, and to provide decision-makers with information and tools to support effective biodiversity conservation policies and practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growing degradation of plants, animal species and ecosystems, providing essential services to humans, calls for new approaches to protect our biodiversity. Scenario-development, as well as an increased engagement of stakeholders, could be the cornerstone of a renewed ambition for mitigating the negative effects of human activity on biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Magnus Tannerfeldt</strong>, <strong>Programme coordinator of </strong><a href=""https://www.biodiversa.eu/2023/06/20/biodivscen-addressing-the-degradation-of-ecosystems-through-scenario-making/"" target=""_blank""><strong>BiodivScen</strong></a> , Vice chair of Biodiversa+, and expert of The Swedish research council for sustainable development (FORMAS), is a firm believer in training and building capacity for policy making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tannerfeldt highlights <strong>the need to consider a range of potential future scenarios in order to identify risks, develop strategies, prioritise actions, and improve decision-making</strong>. By developing and testing multiple scenarios, stakeholders can gain a better understanding of the complex interactions between biodiversity, human activities, and environmental change, and can identify more effective strategies for promoting positive outcomes, such as addressing the causes of biodiversity loss, implementing sustainable management practices in agriculture, and ensuring that biodiversity conservation and management are integrated into all relevant policies and programs at local ad international levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BiodivScen is part of a broader trend towards using scenario-making as a<a href=""https://www.biodiversa.org/1823/download"" target=""_blank""> key tool</a>  for biodiversity conservation and sustainability. Other initiatives, such as the <a href=""https://www.naturefuturesframework.org/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Nature Futures Framework</strong></a><strong> </strong> developed under IPBES, <strong>aim to develop scenarios of positive futures for nature</strong>. The framework incorporates various knowledge systems across multiple scales and sectors to help inform assessments of science-based policy options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the development of scenarios, a better connection between scenario-making and policymaking is crucial to ensure that scientific knowledge is effectively used to inform decisions. <em>“There is a need to strengthen the production of knowledge for monitoring biodiversity, for the research, for systems analysis, for scenario making”</em>, Tannerfeldt says, to better inform decision-makers in the public and the private sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He emphasises the importance of training and building the capacity of decision-makers for incorporating scientific findings in policy-related decisionmaking. Therefore, there is a need for increased efforts to inform decision-makers on the potential benefits of using scientific data and analysis in policymaking leading to more informed and effective policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s more, it will be crucial to increase public awareness and citizen engagement to ensure that biodiversity preservation is addressed by many different interest groups. That’s why, in the future, Tannerfeldt hopes that biodiversity preservation will become a central and transversal theme of society debates. For this to happen, there is a need for a change in the dominant narrative around biodiversity preservation. <em>“Negative scenarios have dominated too much”</em>, he says. <em>“There is a need to create narratives that look at the possibilities and what we need to do, scenarios and models of a desirable future, to give hope to people”</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different forms of regulations will be needed to ensure that policies are designed with a focus on long-term sustainability rather than short-term gains. That is notably the case for the regulation of agriculture, fishing, forestry, and over-harvesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a more practical note, the Programme coordinator argues in favour of the <em>“de-compartmentalisation of policymaking to encourage strategic long-term integrated thinking at all levels”</em>, which could be driven by the creation of scientific advisory bodies ensuring that policies are based on the best available scientific evidence. <em>“Our hope would be that the real societal transformation that we see is needed, is at least beginning to happen in several cities, regions and maybe countries, where you could integrate nature, economy and human wellbeing.”</em> By using these tools, we can better understand the complex and far-reaching impacts of human activities on the environment and take the necessary steps to protect and restore biodiversity before it’s too late.&nbsp;</p>

To meet evolving customer needs, embrace cutting-edge technologies, and fulfil environmental commit-ments, the transport sector is turning to automation for sustainable, cost-effective, and inclusive mobility solutions. However, the interplay between automation, reskilling, and sustainability is more complex than meets the eye.</p>","<p><a href=""https://wetransform-project.eu/about/"" target=""undefined"">WE-TRANSFORM</a> is on a mission. The project leverages existing data and the collective expertise of individuals to craft a cross-national Living Hub. It serves as both a knowledge repository of research actions related to transport automation, as well as a catalyst for smarter decisions paving the way for innovative, evidence-based policymaking in the mobility landscape.</p>
<p>For Cristina Pronello, Professor at the <em>Politecnico di Torino</em>, Italy, and Coordinator of the project, automation is changing the way in which we work and live our daily lives. In particular, automation will have a significant impact on mobility’s future development, implying big changes for both the organisation of companies and the way that employees work. There are also operational issues and impacts thanks to automation and digitalisation, as well as financial and regulatory aspects.</p>
<p>Pronello makes the example of the automation of the metro in her city in Torino, Italy. Automated transport vehicles have an effect on the workforce, according to her: “You do not need drivers anymore because the metro is driverless, but it implies a shift of tasks, jobs, and competences to be acquired as well as a different way to care about customers and travellers. Another example is the airport, the check-in is less in person and more and more online. This has an effect on the workforce because it means less people work there. So, a lot of the tasks are shifted to the end consumer, but the workers are doing a different job.”</p>
<p>WE-TRANSFORM leverages the effective collaboration of stakeholders in the mobility industry for in-depth dialogues to understand and respond to the challenges posed by automation on the transport labour force.</p>
<p>“We exchange with the stakeholders to understand what the problem is: if and how automation has impacted their daily jobs. This means we have a clear vision about what are the effects and impacts of digitalisation and automation in the transport sector.” says Pronello.</p>
<p>Using the outcomes of previously done research, such as main trends in the transportation sector, impacts on workers, and legal consequences, WE-TRANSFORM called stakeholders to share their views on the future of the workforce in mobility, with a focus on identification of encountered difficulties and required sources to overcome them. The stakeholders identified several drivers, namely: disaffection and dissatisfaction with their jobs; management skills not being up to date with the evolution of mobility; workers at lower levels often being more up to date with technological trends than their managers.</p>
<p>Another important trend is the relocation of companies and offshoring, which has increased with automation. The last influencing factor is a lack of attention towards worker training, which is linked with the lack of finances that a company can provide for it.</p>
<p>Who is most impacted are the workers and the end users, as automation will change the way that people work, and customer care will see a shift in how services are delivered and experienced. “There is also the risk that automation will leave the end user alone in a desert of machines, so this is the reason why in automation, customer care is so important.” Pronello cautions.</p>
<p>When asked to consider what the future of mobility is, Pronello has a clear vision: “I expect a mix between hard and soft skills, where technology takes a secondary role to humanistic knowledge rather than being the primary focus of expertise. The ability of human beings to observe, listen and empathise with others will be a must-have. I also want to see a mobility trainer, a person who can teach other people how to travel in a sustainable way and educate people about the values related to sustainable mobility. In this case, the money that is devoted to the advancement of technology should be more used for training and educating people, because this is the only way to change people’s behaviour.”</p>
<p>In the mobility setting, the driver of a now driverless vehicle could redirect their skills to support and facilitate the customer travel experience. “Those people can shift their focus on exchanging with other human beings, thus balancing the entrance of automated technologies with greater social interactions.” Pronello says.</p>
<p>When asked about the implications for sustainability, Pronello adds these last thoughts: “The green transition cannot be achieved only through technology but through behaviours that utilise the full potential of these technologies. To truly drive the green transition, we must articulate why individuals and communities should embrace these technologies in a way that aligns with sustainability goals, rather than simply relying on technological advancements alone.""</p>

The support of the FOD Cancer project team consisted of several interactive events with the Mission Board, horizon scanning, and the provision of three specific reports. This synthesis report gives a concise overview of the deliverables, which are provided in full as annexes.</p>
<p>Based on the “Scoping Paper” (Annex I) this synthesis report demonstrates the challenges for future cancer research. It summarises some major aspects behind the urgency of the cancer topic – not only medical aspects but a broader spectrum that includes prevention, prediction, care, diagnosis and treatment as well as other economic and social aspects. The report is the result of a targeted literature review of recent documents where the future of the fight against cancer is discussed. The main goal of the review was to identify and assess both consolidated trends and drivers, and other phenomena at the periphery that are likely to have impacts on the future of cancer. Mission Board members revised the report and gave additional inputs online (since an onsite scoping meeting had to be sacrificed to meet the COVID-19 containment measures).</p>
<p>Building on the outcome of the revised Scoping Paper, two scenarios were developed discussing diverging directions of cancer development and the measures to fight cancer (Annex II). The two future health scenarios were based on scenarios from an earlier EU-funded project entitled ""FRESHER - FoResight and Modelling for European HEalth Policy and Regulation"", which aimed to identify future research policies to effectively address the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) using emerging health scenarios with a time horizon up to 2050.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the online scenario workshop with members from the Mission Board on ‘Fighting Cancer’ and members from the European Commission, the two FRESHER scenarios were discussed, revised and feedback for desirable futures with regard to fighting cancer was collected. The two scenarios are briefly presented in this report as well. Under the impression of the two scenarios, the Mission Board members and EC representatives were guided by the FOD Cancer team to discuss online in five focus groups - in parallel - different stakeholder perspectives with regard to desirable milestones that may be achieved in the future to make prevention, diagnosis, treatment and survival of cancer more effective. These stakeholder perspectives comprised “Members of the European Parliament against Cancer”, “General Practitioners”, “Pharmaceutical Companies”, “Patient Organisations”, and “Survivors”. Out of these discussions, the FOD team developed three roadmaps (Annex III): milestones for prevention, milestones for diagnosis and treatment, and milestones for survivorship. The roadmaps are also briefly summarised.</p>

How will we travel, how will our society be organised, how will our schools function and what kind of jobs will people have? These are just some of the questions we have been asking Europeans to reflect on as part of the #OurFutures project launched by the EU Policy Lab. Through it, we collect EU citizens' images through a narrative inquiry method.<br><br>We recently did this in Greece, in close collaboration with foresight experts in the Greek government by reaching out to Greek citizens to gain insights into how people in this part of Europe would like the future to look like.<br><br>We have spoken to <strong>Epaminondas Christophilopoulos</strong> (UNESCO chair on Futures research at the Foundation for Research and Technology) and <strong>Vivian Efthimiopoulou</strong> (communication expert), focusing on some of their findings which demonstrate the value of citizen-generated future images for developing people-centric policies at both national and EU level.</p>
","<p><strong>Why did the UNESCO team in Greece join the #OurFutures initiative? <br></strong><br><em>Epaminondas Christophilopoulos (EC)</em>: During the last 10 years, we have been systematically collaborating with the EU Policy Lab of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) on various foresight initiatives. For example, we have extensively used the Scenario Exploration System (SES) in various projects, as a tool for communicating scenarios and for developing ideas for strategies. This is why we were excited to participate in the #OurFutures initiative, which offers people the opportunity to freely express their images of the future, their fears, hopes or anxieties.  <br><br>In most foresight projects we tend to collect the views and the future images of a rather small group of experts. The questionnaires used in these exercises are usually based on a specific set of questions and define a specific agenda of topics of interest. On the contrary, #OurFutures helps to 'decolonise' the future, offering  participants the opportunity to select any topic of interest, both local and global - while also allowing them to self-evaluate their stories. <br><br>What is interesting with Greece is that most of the focus has and is being laid on the present and the past, but there are practically no studies exploring society’s views for the long-term future - this is why I like the #OurFutures project, which provides both the structure and the content for initiating a conversation among groups of participants.<br><br>We therefore decided to fully support the initiative, to use it in all our workshops and public events, and also to utilise the collected information in parallel with other studies we have been running in Greece, like Innovation 2040.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What key findings you were you able to draw from the stories #OurFutures collected so far from Greek participants?<br></strong> <br><em>Vivian Efthimiopoulou (VE)</em>: During these first months of the project, we have collected extremely interesting data on which we can base our further research, but we have already identified some telling insights.   <br><br>It was interesting to see that the future images are shaped mainly by personal experiences and social media. It comes as no surprise that younger people (18-25 year olds) believe that it is mainly their personal experiences which shape their future image. But as people get older, they probably learn to recognise most of the factors that shape their perception of the world, their future as well as their past.<br><br>Another important and optimistic, if I may say, finding is that the vast majority of respondents feel empowered to bring change. Especially after Greece's difficult past two decades, many of the participants were able to think not only positively, but also beyond their own county, imagining stories with a global interest.<br><br>Perhaps one of the main takeaways from this project is that most participants in the project believe that the responsibility for making change happen falls on politicians, businesspeople and scientists. Therefore, political and financial leadership is necessary for a better future: from where we can extrapolate a very positive element of this exercise, namely the belief and trust in public institutions, but who need to step up in the face of current crises.</p>
<p><strong>As Chief Scientific Advisor on Strategic Foresight for the Presidency of the Greek Government, what policy-relevant insights can you draw? Why is the #OurFutures initiative valuable for policymakers and policymaking? <br></strong><br>EC: Greeks are very proud about their past. Even the recent, difficult periods of modern Greek history are present in a constant passionate and heated public discourse. <br><br>In this context, it came as a surprise for many - although not for us - to see that the #OurFutures survey generated such interest. This entire process has been extremely useful to demonstrate an alternative way to communicate and listen to what broader society has to say. <br><br>Another important finding, which can come in handy to any government, are the topics of interest that emerged and that are quite different from the ones usually brought up in the mainstream media. One example that springs to mind is migration: although Greece is on the eastern border of the EU and one of the main points of entry into Europe for a lot of migrants, migration scored very low as an issue for many respondents.<br><br>Another noteworthy takeaway is that most participants are very concerned about the future, underlining the need for politicians across the political spectrum to start addressing the serious environment challenges, societal imbalances and the impacts of technology. It also becomes clear that education systems need to invest more in the study of the future(s), not only of the past and to integrate futures literacy, in parallel with other soft skills, from primary and secondary education onwards.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Project Team Consists of:</strong><br><strong>Alena Tomanová</strong><br>She has been involved in non-formal education in the field of youth work since 2008. She is currently working at YouthWatch, where she focuses on project coordination, as well as expert, methodological, and research activities. At present, she particularly enjoys mapping and analysing new youth trends and collaborating with a network of trendspotters. She is also part of the network of social innovators in Slovakia, where she introduces futures literacy into youth work and experiments in this field through various international and national projects. For example, she has worked on topics such as the future of healthy relationships, leisure time, education, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas D'hooge</strong><br>He is a Belgium-based speaker, trainer and facilitator in Futures Literacy. He works with youth workers, educators and public organisations to make futures thinking practical and inclusive, from classroom activities to full Futures Literacy Labs. Active in the Teach the Future community, he helps teams imagine multiple futures, test assumptions and act with more agency today. Thomas is developing the “Futures Barometer” for schools and is writing a handbook, translating field practice into accessible methods. He works in Dutch and English.</p>
<p><br><strong>Tomáš Pešek</strong><br>For two decades, Tomáš has been dedicated to developing the potential of young people and seeking innovative ways to support their development. He is most familiar with non-formal education, coaching, and experiential pedagogy, areas in which he has long been active. He lectures in several programmes and also conducts long-term training for youth workers on the use of a coaching approach. He is a speaker at various conferences, where he often discusses the young generation, current youth trends, and how to prepare them for the future. He values long-term visions, an emphasis on quality, and projects with real impact.</p>
<p><br><strong>Petr Fridrich</strong><br>He graduated in Andragogy and Human Resources Management at Charles University. He has worked as an HR specialist, learning manager, development consultant, and lecturer. He also has experience with cultural projects and is known as a “laughologist,” public speaker on mental health, and founder of the stand-up show Nudná konference (“The Boring Conference”). For fifteen years, he worked in research and media, later as a strategic and innovation consultant. He collaborates with the international think-tank Innovation in Politics, co-founded the Czech platform for the Inner Development Goals, and is a member of the global Wellbeing Economy Alliance.

FORGE examined issues of future-regarding lawmaking in an interdisciplinary manner, combining expertise on futures studies, political science, and jurisprudence. The aim of the study was to analyse the status of future generations and their rights in current legislative processes, and to map and compare practices for foresight and consideration of future generations in different political contexts, nationally and internationally. The purpose of the project was to increase understanding on i) how future generations can be better taken into account in policymaking; ii) how foresight can be better utilised in lawmaking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FORGE-project was unique – there had not previously been a study with a similar scope in Finland and comparable international examples are, to the best knowledge of the authors, extremely rare. FORGE supported the preparation of the second part<br>of the Government Report on the Future. The project was funded by the Government’s analysis, assessment and research activities (VN TEAS) and was conducted during 1/2022–11/2022 by researchers of the University of Turku, Åbo Akademi University and Tampere University.</p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<p>From an international comparison, Finland already has an advanced national foresight system and can be regarded as a pioneer in futureregarding policymaking. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of using foresight and considering future generations as a part of lawmaking. Such improvement could be achieved by developing and upgrading the existing institutions and practices and by making more incremental changes in practices, modes of interaction, and attitudes. For example, foresight should be conducted more as a continuous activity, and future generations’ interests and rights should be considered more systematically in legislative processes, while acknowledging the plurality of future interests.</p>
<p><strong>Development proposals:</strong></p>

Green hydrogen, it is assumed, can play a significant role in the de-carbonization of high-energy-intensive industries and (some means of) transport as it can both deliver and store a tremendous amount of energy. For hydrogen energy to be sustainable - in other words, for it to be ""green"" - it must be produced from renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar. However, since at least in some EU countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, the potential of renewable energy production is limited in the sense that it won't be able to meet projected green hydrogen demands, policymakers are increasingly looking to establish international partnerships to produce green hydrogen outside the EU and import it for national use - with a particular focus on countries in the Global South.&nbsp;</p>
","<p>Resource extraction from the Global South for use by populations and industries in the Global North is nothing new and has often been accompanied by maladies such as environmental pollution, poverty, economic decline, elite conflicts, and even civil strife in countries of the Global South (This is often and slightly misleadingly referred to as the ""resource curse"" as it is not the existence of natural resources per se that results in unstable political regimes and economies but the power relations and political strategies around them). Extracting and using energy from renewable resources, such as solar and wind, to produce and subsequently export green hydrogen might differ from extracting natural gas, oil, minerals and wood and could offer an opportunity to leave carbon-locked pathways and relationships. However, nothing suggests that the current mode of international interactions and the logic of partnership between the Global South and the Global North will change automatically when it comes to hydrogen production and export. Change will require conscious decision-making and actions on behalf of European (import) countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of a ""just"" energy transition is more or less explicitly part of the climate and energy transition goals of the EU as well as the UN's SDGs but definitions of what it means to ensure a just hydrogen transition are still subject to perception and negotiation. At its minimum, however, a just hydrogen transition needs to include the principle that the advance of the energy transition in one part of the world (or for a specific group) cannot be to the detriment of another - now and in the future. Specifically, a just hydrogen transition needs to ensure that international hydrogen partnerships will not prioritize hydrogen production and export at the cost of failing to achieve the national climate and energy transition goals of the export countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of a just hydrogen transition can be implemented and assessed along different justice dimensions put forward by scholars of environmental and energy justice over the past two decades. A vast body of literature on distributional, procedural, and recognition justice highlights that justice is not just a matter of institutionalized access points and equal distribution even though these dimensions of justice are not to be neglected (see for example Sovacool 2016 and Sovacool et al. 2017). Particularly scholars of political ecology have brought questions of power and recognition to the debate of just transition: Who has the resources to access the conversation, who has a seat at the table to have their concerns heard, and who has the power to implement decisions? Furthermore, scholarship has pointed to the role of multi-levels and scales when conceptualizing justice in the energy transition (see for example Jenkins et al. 2018). A wind park built on land claimed by customary land rights might have immediate negative effects on the local population while having positive effects on national and regional greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, both the past and the future bring additional dimensions of justice to the table. Europe's history as colonizers puts the responsibility on contemporary European policymakers to not repeat Europe's past mistakes and to - at the same time - avoid replacing current energy transition costs onto future generations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dimensions of justice are complex and have immediate and visible implications for the everyday lives and bodies of (parts of the) populations in the Global South. The current mode of international interactions and the logic of North-South partnership do nothing to correct longstanding injustices and inequalities. Hydrogen strategies, that take justice seriously, need to address these issues rather immediately.</p>

","<p>The twelve scenarios in this deep dive are informed by transhumanism, portraying futures in which the human condition – our bodies, functions, and lives – and the features of societies are fundamentally transformed by technology. Even though scenarios are built along the lines of particular scientific and/or technological advancements, the discussion spreads over sociotechnical ensembles and the re-conceptualization of the relationship between technology and society by 2040.<br><br>The work leading to this report started with a horizon scanning exercise to identify a series of technological innovations and scientific breakthroughs that may be considered key factors towards re-engineering human nature. In parallel, the authors explored diverse narratives regarding the human condition and significance in the world, dreams and fears embodied in the so-called collective imaginary, echoing through myths and fantasies to literature, cinematography and the wider culture. At the intersection of these explorations, twelve topics were selected and further expanded into scenarios. They are not intended to cover the full spectrum of themes regarding human enhancement, but present a relevant ‘sample’ of potential future trajectories.</p>
<p>We propose these narratives as<strong> exploratory scenarios</strong>, describing futures where both positive and negative consequences are palpable. They are not normative, outlininga vision of the future deemed desirable. We invite readers to regard them as devices for imagining the future and debating the future. They aim to nurture a reflection on the dynamics of change, future opportunities and potential threats, and in doing so they contribute to future preparedness.</p>
<p>Three types of scenarios were developed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first type describe futures where scientific and technological advancements <strong>enhance embodied experiences</strong>: <em>Sensory augmentation</em>:  extending human senses beyond the natural limits and adding sensorial modalities which are not native to humans. <em>Sensory and brain stimulation, psychedelic microdosin</em>g: inducing altered states of consciousness, for healing purposes or for fostering new perspectives on being human. <em>Molecular therapies for delaying aging</em>; and <em>new artificial reproductive technologies </em>allowing people to be fertile until much older age.</li>
<li>The second type explore futures where human capabilities are <strong>extended by embodying non-biological means</strong>: a significant share of elderly people using <em>exoskeletons</em> for prolonging active life, for maintaining their mobility or as a form of assisted living; <em> brain-computer interfaces</em> leveraged in semi-automatized work environments, to improve learning outcomes, and to control smart devices;  <em>Brain to brain communication</em> supporting cognitive and emotion sharing, leading to the creation of ‘hive minds’ covering multiple aspects of life.</li>
<li>The third type focus on the <strong>simulation and replication of the human body and mind</strong>:<em> Digital body twins</em> allowing alert signals for disease prevention and the simulation of the short- and long-term effects of a person’s behavior on their health and body; <em>Digital twins of the brain</em> allowing testing hypotheses in cognitive science, in mental health studies, responses to different types of treatments;  <em>Digital immersive worlds</em> – gaming/ fantasy worlds or ‘mirror worlds’ that are replicating real-life environments – hosting interactions among people and automated entities;  <em>Digital replicas of the deceased</em> changing the socio-political understanding of grief; and <em>Artificial agents</em> with complex underlying computational procedures (including e.g. self-reflection, development of value system, affective computing) and sophisticated interfaces calling for new theoretical frameworks of consciousness.<br><br><br>***<br>The twelve scenarios presented in this deep dive are part of the Foresight towards the 2nd Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe project, which was conducted by Foresight on Demand Consortium on behalf of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (DG RTD).</li>

This fast-moving landscape presents a crucial challenge: how do we effectively guide current professionals toward the <strong>emerging career opportunities of tomorrow?</strong> This is one of the questions we aim to tackle within the ekip project, the European Cultural and Creative Industries Innovation Policy Platform. <br><br>The EKIP initiative, funded by Horizon Europe, is dedicated to understanding and accelerating these transitions through research, policy, and collaboration. For each sector it studies, EKIP brings together policymakers, researchers, and creative practitioners to translate emerging needs into actionable frameworks for change.<br><br>Our foresight exercise, conducted within ekip's identification phase , addresses this challenge by mapping actionable career paths from the future back to the present. Our method employed <strong>social media listening to track real-time conversations </strong>across sectors, helping stakeholders anticipate change and enabling the co-creation of smarter innovation policies .</p>
","<p>Our process began by defining <strong>""future creative personas""</strong>, new professions in the CCIs identified by monitoring emerging skills and job mentions within European creative communities. These personas sparked vital conversations, but the practical need remained: <strong><em>how can today's practitioners evolve in this shifting market?<br></em></strong><br>To bridge the gap between ""future potential"" and ""present action,"" we employed a technique called backcasting. Unlike traditional forecasting, which projects current trends forward, <strong>backcasting starts with a desirable future state</strong> (in our case, the new creative persona) and <strong>works backward to identify the necessary milestones, skill pivots, and strategies </strong>to achieve that future from the present day. We combined these future visions with real-world data on current job roles to build practical career trajectories.<br></p>
","<p><ins>Case Study:</ins> Let's explore the career path leading to the Interactive Storyteller.<br><br>The<strong> Interactive Storyteller</strong> designs and develops narrative experiences that empower audience participation and agency. They work across a variety of media, including games, VR/AR, interactive installations, and transmedia projects, focusing on crafting branching narratives and dynamic dialogues that allow users to influence the story's direction and outcome.<br><br>The path to becoming an Interactive Storyteller can start from several existing professions, such as a Graphic Designer.</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>Graphic Designer</strong> today, focused on establishing mastery over visual communication, composition, and aesthetics and providing the fundamental visual literacy, can start pivoting their profile by moving through roles that progressively build the necessary ""future skills"" for interactive storytelling.</li>
</ol>
","<p>2. The first key step is transitioning to a <strong>UX Designer</strong>, pivoting the focus to functional design by acquiring skills in UX/UI Principles and Design Thinking to strategically address user behavior and digital flow.&nbsp;</p>
","<p>3. This role then evolves into an<strong> Experience Designer</strong>, where the scope expands beyond the 2D screen into immersive and spatial design, demanding proficiency with AR/VR Technologies and developing system design for complex, non-linear experiences.&nbsp;</p>
","<p>4. Finally, the ultimate role of the <strong>Interactive Storyteller </strong>combines this expertise to design and develop narrative experiences that allow audience participation and agency across various media like games and VR/AR.</p>
","<p>By applying the backcasting methodology to different future professions (Interactive Storyteller, AI Ethicist, and Heritage Strategist), we identified <strong>several common, critical themes</strong> that policymakers, educators, and industry leaders must address to facilitate this career evolution in the CCIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access to Cutting-Edge Tools and Training (Upskilling)</strong>: Professionals across all paths require accessible training in expensive, cutting-edge tools like AR/VR and advanced AI software. There is a need for constant support to integrate technical fundamentals (like NPL/ML basics) into traditional humanities and creative training.</li>
<li><strong>Networking and Cross-Sector Collaboration</strong>: The new roles demand intense collaboration between diverse expertise: creative leaders, problem solvers, technologists, and even legal teams. Incentivizing and funding cross-sector collaboration platforms and networks is highly important.</li>
<li><strong>Funding and Investment Models:</strong> To support the R&amp;D and pilot projects needed for professionals to gain experience in these capital-expensive fields, there is a critical need for long-term financial products and grant structures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The backcasting process proves that the path to future CCI professions is not a leap, but a guided series of skill pivots and strategic upskilling. </strong>The next step is to use this map to actively guide and reorient current professionals toward these emerging opportunities.<br></p>

From identifying trends and weak signals to fleshing out rich scenario narratives and bringing them to life in experiential and immersive ways, generative AI is empowering foresight analysts in their endeavour to anticipate uncertainties and support<br>policymakers in preparing better for the future. As generative agents powered by LLMs become more adept at mimicking human behaviour, they could offer foresight practitioners and policy analysts new ways to gain additional insights at greater speed and scale, supporting their work.<br><br>However, to effectively integrate generative AI and LLMs into foresight practice, it is crucial to critically evaluate their limitations and biases. Human oversight and expertise are essential for ensuring the reliability and validity of AI-generated outputs, as well as the need for transparency, accountability, and other ethical considerations. It is important to note that, while generative AI can augment human capabilities, it should not be seen as a replacement for human involvement and judgment.<br><br>By combining human expertise with generative AI capabilities, foresight analysts can uncover new opportunities to enhance strategic planning in policymaking. A proactive and informed approach to adopting generative AI in foresight analysis may lead to more informed, nuanced, and effective strategies when dealing with complex futures.</p>

Technological advance, financial viability, and regulatory frameworks are slowly aligning to permit deep-sea mining (DSM). While many rejoice in these developments, a variety of actors are calling for a moratorium on the nascent industry. Most notably, the European Commission released a <a href=""https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/publications/setting-course-sustainable-blue-planet-joint-communication-eus-international-ocean-governance-agenda_en"" target=""_blank"">Joint Communication</a>  stating that not enough knowledge about the risks of DSM is available and that more research is to be conducted to make DSM sustainable. With deep-sea mining closer than ever to becoming a reality on the one hand, and calls for a moratorium on the other hand, it is important to discuss future directions of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) for a flourishing deep-sea ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
","<p>The way in which we view the world and how we conceptualise nature shape our attitude towards it and the type of STI to be desired and pursued. The project <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/260eaaf7-6bd7-11ee-9220-01aa75ed71a1"" target=""_blank""><strong>S&amp;T&amp;I for 2050”</strong></a><strong> </strong>provides a framework to imagine different sustainable futures depending on underlying values and human-nature relations. Three perspectives on ecosystem performance are described:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>“Protecting and restoring ecosystems”, concerned with preservation of ecosystems by managing the impact from human activities;</li>
<li>“Co-shaping socio-ecological systems”, concerned with simultaneous development of social practices and ecological processes towards resilience and sustainability renewal;</li>
<li>“Caring within hybrid collectives”, concerned with the establishment of caring relationships in new local collectives with humans and other entities on an equal footing.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three perspectives offer different views on notions of the deep sea and how and why we should promote its flourishing, and therefore delineate different views on deep-sea mining. The first perspective, i.e. protecting and restoring, views the deep sea as natural capital, a sphere that is separated from that of humans. The ecosystem is valued according to cost and benefit analysis (CBA), often based on ecosystem service. DSM would thus proceed when consistent with the findings of CBA and would need to limit as much as possible the effects on the environment. The second perspective, i.e. co-shaping, views the deep sea as a complex and unstable ecosystem that is co-shaped by both humans and non-human deep-sea entities. Ecosystems must flourish to allow for our long-term survival. Finding a governance system that is beneficial for all human and non-human entities part of the socio-ecological system is thus the proposed attitude towards assuring a healthy deep sea. The third perspective, i.e. immersing and caring, does not see a difference between humans and nature, thus also the deep sea. These two elements are one and the same, making humans deeply connected with a pluriverse of other beings. Caring for the deep sea and its health is not a choice, and deep-sea mining can only result from a negotiation between creatures to allow all to flourish on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stemming from these perspectives on deep-sea performance, I sketched three 2050 scenarios on the future of deep-sea mining focused on ecosystem performance.</p>
<p><strong>P1 scenario: The masters of the deep sea</strong></p>
<p>Deep-sea mining is an established industry. A plethora of norms, tribunals and enforcement bodies assure that all contractors operating in national and international waters follow protocols and respect the boundaries and marine protected areas (MPAs). The deep sea has been carefully mapped via satellite imagery and all mineral deposits, before being approved for exploitation, have been studied in all their biological and chemical characteristics. Each operation in international water is to be approved behind closed doors by a board of experts selected by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), of which all countries are member. Meticulous risk assessments and environmental impact assessments are conducted to measure whether the extraction of minerals from a determined area makes economic sense against the loss of other ecosystem services. The “do no significant harm” principle (DNSH) is adopted as a default in deep-sea mining policymaking. The ISA also has the power to set caps to the quantity of minerals extracted each year depending on the indicators of stressors on the deep-sea ecosystem. It has happened in the past that restrictive caps resulted in fierce legal battles between investors and the ISA in a process alike that of the ISDS. Mining operations are required to adopt advanced technologies built on deep-sea robotics and AI to limit their impact in the extraction of minerals. When in 2032 a DSM operation caused a large-scale biodiversity loss that impacted numerous fisheries in the Pacific, controlling or eliminating the plumes of sediment became a priority of new technologies. Sensors are placed all throughout the deep sea to continuously monitor the temperature, the toxicity and water movements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>P2 scenario: Embracing deep uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>Deep-sea mining has been practiced for 15 years now. The global moratorium put in place in 2025 allowed the international system to adapt and create a suitable regulatory framework to govern deep-sea mining effectively. Uncertainty in conducting mining operations in the deep sea was accepted and embedded in a highly responsive and adaptive governance structure. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) was joined by a multitude of organisations, such as the Deep Ocean Protection Authority (DOPA), the DSM States Consortium, and Atlantic Fisheries Agency (AFA), in order to assure as much as possible a governance of a global common in the name of resilience of the ecosystem. The precautionary principle is a prerogative for all decisions regarding deep-sea mining activities so that long term flourishing is possible. Feedback loops in this structure have allowed prevention of significant strains on the deep-sea ecosystem and quick interdisciplinary response to rebalance the ecosystem. For this aim, data from indicator species and sensors placed not only in the deep-sea, but also in shallow waters, on coastal land, and in the atmosphere is collected in a central and open-access database and analysed by personnel with the help of AI technologies. Socio-economic factors, such as the high demand of a specific mineral on the market, are also factored in to predict and manage changes in the extraction pace and protection activities. The ISA has remained the main organisation controlling deep-sea mining activities on the seabed beyond national jurisdiction and has undergone deep change in its internal norms allowing for a pervasive transparency and increased flexibility in its activities and regulations. While on the one hand this increased the resilience of the system, financial viability of DSM suffered also due to the volatility of the DSM metals market. In any case, technological developments on land, particularly recycling, and societal change towards circular economies have determined a diminishing need of raw materials, thus alleviating the push for deep sea extraction. Operations in the deep sea are conducted using biomimetic technologies developed by marine engineers in collaboration with biologists to be unintrusive to deep-sea fauna.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>P3 perspective: Deep-sea connections</strong></p>
<p>Deep-sea mining is now old memory. The fermentation around the industry died even before a commercial operation happened in international water. Although it seemed that an energy transition might have been impossible without DSM, the major improvements in recycling and the decoupling of the economy rendered the practice futile. All this was accompanied by a paradigmatic shift in our relationship with Nature. Past extractive industries are unthinkable now due to the enormous harm that they bring to Planet Earth as a whole. Oceans and the deep sea are as close to humans’ conscience and care as the soil on which they walk. Still, when new materials are needed, humans can dive to the deep sea and communicate with its inhabitants to determine together which polymetallic nodule or how much softer sulphide deposit can be harvested. This was enabled by technological breakthroughs in diving equipment and symbiotic robotics amongst others. Knowledge is pursued not with the aim to manage the deep sea but to enhance the whole ecosystem capacity to sustain thriving life and interspecies collaboration. Extensive scientific knowledge of the deep sea and its biogeochemical characteristics is complemented by both human and other creatures’ indigenous knowledge. Cobalt-rich crusts are not mined because the technology currently available would be too invasive and destructive. Nevertheless, as the water levigates the rock and particles of metals are dispersed in the water, some people filter out the water and collect these. The deep sea belongs to no one and every living creature simultaneously – its flourishing cannot be separated from that of all other creatures, including humans.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
","<p>These three scenarios offer a peek into how different views of the world might impact deep-sea mining and Science, Technology, and Innovation directions related to a sustainable deep-sea. There are plenty of questions that the scenarios create and leave unanswered and plenty of open points that will be decided upon in the next years. Many of them are related to STI, including governance innovations, and many others engage with the complex geopolitical arena surrounding deep-sea mining.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Will we create technologies to source deep-sea minerals sustainably? How will sustainability be conceptualised for the deep sea? How will developments in AI, big data and robotics impact the deep-sea mining industry? Which governance structure could effectively control extraction of minerals from the deep-sea? Can deep-sea minerals ever be recovered without harming deep-sea life? How will the rising attention to global commons impact activities in the deep sea? Will the DSM international challenge strengthen multilateralism or further break it down? Will deep-sea minerals be part of green transitions? Will the European Union prioritise assuring strategic material flows over environmental protection, or will such a trade-off not be required? How will trade-offs between ecological harm and ecological benefits be addressed? How would commercial DSM impact global trade flows and how would power relations and geopolitical strategies change? What will be the social consequences on land mines areas? Which countries will be the losers and winners at the prospect of DSM? Will deep-sea mining become an environmental taboo, similarly to nuclear energy? What knowledge will the EU require to approve deep-sea mining?</em></p>
<p><br></p>
","<p><strong>What is deep-sea mining and why are its minerals strategic?</strong><br><br>Deep-sea mining, defined as the extraction of minerals at depths beyond 200m, revolves around three types of deposit, each containing different metals in nature and quantity. Polymetallic nodules, small rocks at depths of 4000-6000m, contain mainly manganese, copper and nickel. Ferromanganese crusts, the top layer of some undersea mountains and ridges at depths of 800-2500m, contain mainly manganese, cobalt and nickel. Seafloor massive sulphides, deposits from hydrothermal vents activity at depths of 1000-3500m, contain mainly copper, gold and silver[i]. To give an idea of the deep-sea mineral quantities, it has been estimated that there are approximately 1 billion tonnes of cobalt on the ocean floor[ii]. Estimated terrestrial deposits amount to approximately 7.1 million tonnes[iii]. These estimations are not reflected in the work of other researchers (e.g., see image below) indicating considerable uncertainty and knowledges gaps. Other than the mentioned metals, the seabed hosts also sizeable quantities of rare earths (REEs) and lithium, further minerals that are highly relevant for the energy and technological industry. It is not thus a surprise that deep-sea mining proponents continuously highlight the positive impact that the extraction could have in reaching carbon neutrality through batteries and renewable energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Most of the mineral deposits in the deep sea are placed beyond national jurisdiction. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) was created under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea to manage these resources for the benefit of mankind. Currently, 168 countries are members of the ISA.</p>

The project's goal is to create a unified front to identify strategies that will not only bolster the strength of law enforcement agencies through AI but also ensure public benefit. But how far into the future is it useful to look?</p>
<p>In a world where technological advancement is swift and relentless, the EU-funded security research project <a href=""https://aligner-h2020.eu/"" target=""undefined"">ALIGNER</a> focusses on the integration and implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in law enforcement, looking at a more immediate, shorter-term time frame.</p>
<p>Project Coordinator Daniel Lückerath is pragmatic: “The rapid developments in AI technologies and their increasing public availability, as well as permeation throughout many aspects of society – from your fridge to your smartphone – make reliable foresight very far ahead almost impossible”. Hence, ALIGNER bases its strategies on the imminent needs, challenges, and opportunities that law enforcement confronts, considering both the potential misuse of AI and also its constructive use by police and law enforcement in societal contexts.</p>
<p>ALIGNER focuses on a not-too-distant ""future scenario"" where AI is an integral part of daily life, and plays a pivotal role in policing and law enforcement. This approach, enriched by input from advisory boards and research collaborations, has earmarked significant areas where AI's potential criminal usage might be prominent. These areas include disinformation and social manipulation, cybercrimes against individuals and organisations, and the application in vehicles, robots, and drones.</p>
<p>ALIGNER has identified sectors where AI could revolutionise policymaking and law enforcement practices. Promising applications include data handling processes, such as incident and crime reporting, digital forensics for obtaining digital evidence, improving incident reaction and response mechanisms, crime detection, and the use of AI in vehicles, robots, and drones.</p>
<p>Based on these identified sectors, ALIGNER works along four distinct ""narratives"" or topical scenarios, intertwining different aspects across these highlighted categories, giving guidance to the related work in the project. “For each ‘narrative’ that ALIGNER works on, we identify suitable AI technologies.” Lückerath explains. “These are briefly described in so-called scenario cards that summarise the relevant information – what the technology is about, how effective it is, and how robust.” The narratives as discussed thus far have revolved around disinformation and social manipulation, cybercrime against individuals using chatbots, and one on AI-enabled malware, with the fourth one currently being in discussion within the project team. Based on these topical scenarios, assessment methods for the technical, organisational, as well as ethical and legal implications were developed.</p>
<p>As an example, the first ‘narrative’, dealing with disinformation and social manipulation, assumes that criminals use AI for phishing attacks to gather personal data. Through phishing attempts, they identify and attack high-value targets (‘tailored phishing or spear phishing’). The goal of these attacks is to manipulate or coerce targets to gain unauthorised access to computer networks, e.g., of election campaigns, large research companies, or industry organizations. Phishing attacks may involve online attempts to persuade or trick individuals into divulging passwords or access codes or, if the opportunity arises, using harvested data to subject them to blackmail or coercive threats. Besides targeted phishing attacks and data harvesting, criminals may disseminate selective misinformation and disinformation apparently emanating from official or well-informed sources. Disinformation uses artificially generated videos, images, text, and sound, including deep fakes of public figures, and is generated by AI-fuelled ‘bots’. To counter the threat of phishing[KN(2] , law enforcement agencies also bring AI: They use veracity assessment methods to detect disinformation, then employ deanonymisation techniques like authorship attribution and the geolocation of images to identify from where the disinformation originated. This is supported by techniques for the detection of synthetic images and videos.</p>
<p>In the second ‘narrative’, a crypto romance scam, a criminal contacts a victim via an online chat, grooming the victim into believing the scammer is a genuine ‘friend’ and subsequently extracting crypto currency out of the victim. These scams might be supported by generative AI models like ChatGPT, Dall-e, or Midjourney, creating fake profile pictures, voices, and videos, or automating text generation in multiple languages. In the future, the creation of profiles, targeting of individuals, generation of fake crypto currency company sites, and grooming might even become highly automated. To address these threats, law enforcement agencies themselves need to deploy AI-based models to detect generative content, to support automatic detection of scammer profiles as well as scamming victims, to detect voice clones, or to detect crypto currency laundering.</p>
<p>ALIGNER collaborates with professionals from policing, academia, research, industry, and policymaking, including legal and ethics experts, organised in two advisory boards: one for law enforcement expertise, and the other gathering research, industry, and ethics authorities. “To receive a reliable assessment, we need many different experts from different European countries to ensure that we reflect a broad view on these emerging technologies and scenarios. This takes time, especially considering different languages and expertise” Lückerath says.</p>
<p>While AI can be misused by criminals, it also greatly aids law enforcement in combating crime, such as by reducing errors, automating time consuming tasks, identifying potentially suspicious behaviours, and even speeding up legal procedures by predicting possible outcomes based on past cases. However, care must be exercised to avoid AI creating biases and discrimination, as certain geographic areas or groups might be unfairly targeted, leading to a disproportionate increase in arrests.</p>
<p>This is why ALIGNER has developed the <a href=""https://aligner-h2020.eu/fundamental-rights-impact-assessment-fria/"" target=""undefined"">Aligner Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment</a> (AFRIA) tool to enable law enforcement authorities to further enhance their already existing legal and ethical governance systems. This is a method designed to help law enforcement follow ethical guidelines and respect basic rights when using AI systems in their work. It consists of a fundamental rights impact assessment template and an AI System Governance template that help authorities identify, explain, and record possible measures to mitigate any potential negative impact the AI system may have on ethical principles. While in the EU there is no legal obligation to perform such assessments, the AFRIA complements already existing or potential legal and ethical governance systems, such as the forthcoming 2021 AI Act proposed by the European Commission. Depending on the results of negotiations during trialogues, Lückerath explains, “ALIGNER would like to see a practicable and sensible AI regulation that…enables law enforcement agencies to use AI in an ethical, legal, and socially acceptable way, and still allows us to make use of AI technologies for the betterment of society.”</p>
<p>Lückerath envisions a future in which established national centres across Europe support law enforcement agencies with ethical, legal, and socially acceptable implementation and deployment of AI technologies, as well as oversight bodies that would use a harmonised framework to assess AI technologies before, during, and after their deployment. In this envisaged future, a harmonious blend of technology and ethics may very well redefine the contours of law enforcement, empowering agencies with the tools of AI while maintaining steadfast commitment to ethical and legal standards.</p>

These signals were then scrutinised for their significance<br>to the field's future by a diverse group of sector experts which led to the identification of eight key<br>topics: generative AI for healthcare; digital twins; multimodal data analysis; explainable AI in medical<br>imaging; application of AI to specific diseases/conditions; XR - augmented and virtual realities; tensor-<br>valued diffusion encoding, and AI-generated synthetic data for training AI. Furthermore, the workshop<br>identified additional wild cards with high novelty and disruptive potential such as: blockchain, edge<br>computing and differential privacy for secure, AI-driven medical imaging and collaborative healthcare<br>optimisation and quantum medical imaging.</p>
<p><br>Participants also highlighted various factors that could influence the development, adoption, and pro-<br>motion of these emerging technologies, which can be grouped under the following categories: Tech-<br>nological advancements and cross-sector applications; data infrastructure, AI models, and regulatory<br>frameworks; workforce, education and societal factors; clinical efficiency and patient outcomes; trust,<br>ethics, and AI adoption; financial pressures and industry investment in AI healthcare.</p>

The share of renewable energy in the European Union more than doubled between 2004 and 2022. Nevertheless, renewable energy represents only 22 percent of overall energy consumption and 37 percent of electricity generation in the EU. In other words, Europe still has a long way to go, even when it comes to the relatively easy task of converting its electricity production to renewables.</p>","<p>In the meantime, Europe’s goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as enshrined in the<a href=""https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-climate-law_en#:~:text=The%20European%20Climate%20Law%20sets%20a%20legally%20binding,of%20promoting%20fairness%20and%20solidarity%20among%20Member%20States"" target=""_blank""> European Climate Law</a> , has shifted attention to more challenging tasks: the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions from so-called hard-to-abate sectors, such as energy-intensive industries and long-distance transport. These sectors have in common that the direct use of renewable electricity does not offer a comparatively easy pathway for the elimination of greenhouse gases in these sectors. Instead, climate-neutral hydrogen - as feedstock for the production of basic chemicals and synthetic fuels or as a reduction agent in low-carbon steel making, to name a few applications - offers a promising pathway for many of these hard-to-abate sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has raised the important question of where this hydrogen will come from in the future. The <a href=""https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-systems-integration/hydrogen/key-actions-eu-hydrogen-strategy_en"" target=""_blank"">EU Hydrogen Strategy</a>  and the <a href=""https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en#:~:text=REPowerEU%20is%20the%20European%20Commission%E2%80%99s%20plan%20to%20make,as%20a%20Union%2C%20Europe%20can%20achieve%20this%20faster"" target=""_blank"">REPower</a>  plan envision the rapid ramp-up of renewable electricity-based hydrogen, the only climate neutral avenue for producing hydrogen. It has targeted the development of 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen in the EU and an equivalent amount of hydrogen to be imported from partner countries by 2030. These ambitious targets translate into additional renewable electricity generation of approximately 500 TWh, both in the EU and in partner countries. This is also roughly the amount needed to meet the EU’s pre-existing 2030 targets for renewable energy. Together, this means the EU would have to approximately double its renewable energy generation from 1000 TWh to around 2000 TWh per year by 2030. (A further increase of the EU’s renewable energy target has recently been proposed by the EU parliament.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting these targets will have major implications for the future energy geography in Europe. While analysts have pointed to the economic and technical challenges of these goals, the spatial dimension of these developments is not explicitly addressed in the EU strategy and rarely features in policy discussions. The main responsibility for reaching these goals sits with the member states. However, the most ambitious strategies do not necessarily correspond to the geographies with the greatest potential to produce a surplus of renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, Germany has one of the most ambitious hydrogen strategies, targeting 5 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2030. However, among EU member states it has some of the lowest renewable energy potential relative to its existing electricity consumption (see figure 1 below). Spain is among the member states with one of the largest potential renewable energy surplus, and it has an estimated onshore wind power potential that is more than six times that of Germany. However, it is only targeting 4 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2030. Greece, with onshore wind power potential that surpasses Germany’s by more than 70 percent, is targeting electrolyzer capacity of 750 MW by 2030. Similarly, Romania has about 50 percent more potential for wind power production than Germany but has yet to launch a national hydrogen strateg  (for wind power potentials see JRC (2018) report on <a href=""https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC109698"" target=""_blank""><em>Wind energy potentials for EU and neighboring countries</em></a><em> </em>, especially page 38). Solar potential relative to its electricity consumption also vastly surpasses relative potential in Germany (see figure 2 below).</p>
","<p>This is partly offset by significant offshore potential in the North Sea, which will play an important role not only in meeting German hydrogen targets but also those of Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands. These four countries have jointly declared their intention to build 20 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2030, underpinned by 65 GW of offshore wind capacity. Beyond this targeted effort to exploit the potential of the North Sea, hydrogen ambitions in Europe do not correspond primarily to future renewable energy potential but governments’ financial capacity to invest in climate-friendly innovation and industrial development. Apart from the renewable-rich Nordics, Germany and Italy have the most ambitious targets for renewable-based electrolyzer capacity, despite comparatively low levels of renewable energy potential relative to their power demand. France has also formulated ambitious hydrogen targets. However, it represents a special case, given the high share of nuclear energy in its energy mix. It targets 6,5 GW of electricity-based hydrogen, the highest among member states, powered by either renewable or nuclear energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Publikationen/Energie/the-national-hydrogen-strategy.html"" target=""_blank"">German strategy</a>  also places a strong emphasis on developing supply chains for the import of hydrogen to meet its future hydrogen demand. While these efforts address Germany’s expected gap in meeting its hydrogen demand, unlocking intra-European hydrogen trade is not the main priority. It also not explicitly tackled in the EU hydrogen strategy. Although the EU strategy acknowledges the need for imports from non-EU countries, the strategy does not propose any approach for aligning renewable potential among the member states with their hydrogen ambitions, leaving this to the member states. Neither Germany nor the EU engage actively with the question of future geographies of hydrogen demand. Rather, the implicit assumption is that existing demand centers, mainly located in Northern European countries, will largely remain in place, with hydrogen flows developing to satisfy this demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, only <a href=""https://www.miteco.gob.es/content/dam/miteco/es/ministerio/planes-estrategias/hidrogeno/h2executivesummary_tcm30-513831.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Spain</a>  has formulated a vision that diverges from this conception, targeting hydrogen development both for export to Northern European demand centers and for the development of new, climate-neutral industrial supply chains in Spain. It is hoping to leverage its renewable energy potential to attract investment. Such a development has clear analogies in history. The availability of energy resources was instrumental in shaping Europe’s existing industrial geographies, located near centers of coal extraction or along waterways enabling their transportation. While current infrastructure and know-how located in existing industrial regions will no doubt also play an important role, renewable resources are likely to emerge as an important additional factor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date European policy is largely blind to Europe’s renewable energy geography, presumably relegating this to the market forces driving investment decisions. However, in contrast to past energy transitions, current developments are not merely accompanied by governments. Rather policy is the central driver of these changes. Against this background, an engagement with these geographic dimensions and how they might influence the future of energy and industry in Europe could offer important new insights for European policy makers. Spelling out differing scenarios for Europe’s future energy geography and their implications for aspects such as energy security, industrial competitiveness as well as the environmental and social sustainability of hydrogen development could yield important insights for better positioning Europe and its Green Deal internationally. As Europe’s current energy crisis has revealed energy geographies - and how they are shaped by infrastructure decisions - matter.</p>

One starter set component is a set of short videos. The videos introduce and clarify futures thinking and foresight, what to expect from a foresight workshop, and a variety of foresight workshop methods. The videos could serve as promotional material but also help organizers calibrate participants expectations prior to their participation in a foresight workshop.</p>
","<p>Finland Futures Research Centre is developing the video series to help participants prepare to participate in foresight workshops. The videos immediate use is related to the Eye of Europe Pilot Foresight Activities which will run through 2025 and 2026, but the videos will be freely available as a useful resource for foresight organizers outside the scope, and beyond the lifetime, of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Reaching target audiences with foresight beyond text</em></strong></p>
<p>As the Work Package lead of Eye of Europe, the FFRC targets two unofficial ambitions underpinning all project activities: First, lowering the bar for organizing and participating in foresight workshops. Second, moving foresight beyond text. That is, finding new audiences via new formats compared to the classic domain of long text-based foresight reports. The set of Foresight Starter Videos aims to achieve both of these premises, as it uses a format of short videos (3-8 minutes per video) to introduce foresight, futures thinking, and futures methods to new audiences with a playful and welcoming tone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video set has two introductory videos that can be used in advance of any foresight workshop, while the ambition for the following videos relate to specific methods and approaches. The presumed use case is that foresight organizers can provide links to the introductory videos for foresight workshop participants in advance of their participation. We have found at the FFRC that sometimes people, even if they are domain experts in other fields, can be apprehensive prior to foresight workshops, as this may be unfamiliar territory for them (and for people used to being experts, unfamiliar can mean uncomfortable).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Foresight Starter Set Video Roadmap</em></strong></p>
","<p><strong><em>Launching the first videos</em></strong></p>
<p>The series of videos are developed by <strong>Martyn Richards</strong> and <strong>Zainab Yasin </strong>at the Finland Futures Research Centre. The videos will be hosted on the Finland Futures Research Centre’s YouTube Channel as well as feature on the Futures4Europe platform’s upcoming Toolbox, a set of useful methodologies and resources for advancing R&amp;I foresight.&nbsp;</p>

","<p><strong>What is your role in the Eye of Europe Project and what are you currently working on? </strong><br>I am working at the National research Council of Italy (CNR) and I am the coordinator of the activities that CNR is foreseen to implement in the project. CNR was recently responsible for the deliverable of the project aiming to identify the EU’s R&amp;I foresight priorities.<br> <br><strong>Where do you see the field of foresight evolving in the next few years? </strong><br>Foresight has recently received a lot of attention, especially at political level. I do believe that this is due to the increased complexity of the socio-economic system, and its impact on geo-political equilibrium, with consequent interest in the different dynamics of the present scenario towards possible futures. I also face a proliferation of initiatives on foresight, and many of them are struggling for having visibility, despite their valuable contribution to identify the fundamental aspects of some challenges. I think that some technologies are impacting on the role of humans, especially on the perception that we are the ""owners of intelligence and free will"", and foresight more on anthropological and psychological constraints are needed to complement those on technology and environment.<br> <br><strong>What is a piece of foresight related work or publication that you would recommend to read?</strong> <br>Imagination may sometimes be more truthful than knowledge, and I propose a reading that encapsulates this notion. It explores cinematic and literary interpretations of futures as a foresight method and as a way to understand grand societal challenges. Through alternative frames that symbolise ‘futures’, we can observe how speculative and creative fiction can enrich our understanding of such challenges faced in the 21st century.<br><br>Bina et al., (2017), Futures, 86, 166-184: <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328716301288"" target=""_blank"">The future imagined: Exploring fiction as a means of reflecting on today’s Grand Societal Challenges and tomorrow’s options</a> <br> <br><strong>Imagine you’re living in 2050.

<p><strong><em>Welcome to the 26th Futures Conference</em></strong><em> organised by Finland Futures Research Centre and Finland Futures Acacemy, University of Turku in collaboration with Sustainability Transformations Doctoral Education Pilot - SusTra.</em></p>
","<p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKSHOPS</strong></p>
<p>Futures Conference 2026 focuses on the critical theme of the sustainability transformation. This fundamental shift will renew societal and economic systems and practices, while also enhances human agency, well-being and quality of life.<br><br>The conference explores sustainability transformation through various themes, like everyday life and cultural transformation; planetary well-being and health; sustainable production and consumption; technological transformation; governance, justice, trust, and institutional transformations in public administration, politics, and business; and the role of humans, culture, and collective efforts in building a just and sustainable society.<br><br>The conference emphasises the importance of temporality by asking what intergenerational decision-making within the limits of planetary boundaries means in practice. How can geological time perspectives, historical understanding, and futures thinking guide individuals, societies, and humankind towards more sustainable outcomes? How does various individual and collective memories and anticipations impact on unfolding futures and planetary wellbeing?<br><br>Sustainability and temporality can be approached through a multidisciplinary lens, particularly emphasising futures studies, social sciences, humanities, heritage studies, the arts, natural sciences, sustainability science, and business studies. Bridging different fields in an interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach is essential for advancing sustainability transformation. Achieving this in the conference, demands the active and intersectional inclusion of different socio-cultural and more-than-human perspectives through participation of decision-makers, researchers, practitioners, and students.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of abstracts</strong><br><em>We invite researchers, scholars, practitioners, decision-makers and students from universities, research institutes, companies, and governmental and non-governmental organisations to share the latest research results, findings and thoughts on these key topics:</em><br><br>1. Beyond Sustainability – Regeneration and restoration<br>2. Cultural sustainability transformation as an enabler of just sustainability transformation<br>3. Human and more-than-human agency toward planetary well-being and health<br>4. Individual and collective understandings of time and temporalities in sustainability transformation<br>5. Sustainable production and consumption in the light of different economic models<br>6. Justice, trust and sustainability in institutional transformations of governance and working life in public administration, politics, and business<br>7. Leadership, governance, and the management of short-term and long-term sustainability transformations<br>8. The role of AI in sustainability<br>9. Methods and methodology of futures research and sustainability transformation<br></p>

<p><br>The workshop, held on 24 April 2024, had as its primary goal the evaluation and prioritisation of trends and signals on emerging technologies and breakthrough innovation, across all technology readiness levels (TRLs) and within the EIC's Quantum technologies portfolio.</p>
<p><br>Signals for the workshop were gathered from experts, literature review, and text/data mining of patents, publications, and EU-funded projects. These signals were then scrutinised for their significance to the field's future by a diverse group of sector experts which led to the identification of nine key topics: quantum sensing; quantum algorithms for lattice-based computational fluid dynamics models; materials for quantum; Artificial Intelligence for quantum; error correction; solid-state scalability; quantum for Artificial Intelligence; quantum as a service – metacloud; and quantum computers. Furthermore, the workshop identified additional wild cards with high novel-ty and disruptive potential such as quantum sensing AI on edge and molecular spin qubits.<br>Participants also highlighted various factors that could influence the development, adoption, and promotion of these emerging technologies, which can be grouped under the following categories: technical advancements; investment and infrastructure support; cross-sector collaboration; regulatory navigation; talent acquisition; market maturity; and application utility.</p>

","<p>Green Hydrogen offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, changing the world of energy supply completely – geopolitically (some countries depend on their own Renewable Energy sources for their energy supply and not on other countries) and in terms of market structure (no more dependence on a small number of all-powerful oil, carbon and gas companies). Despite today’s inefficiencies in converting energy from nature to Hydrogen and back to power, Hydrogen could be a versatile energy carrier and a central element for energy storage in more abundant but more volatile renewable energy systems. Hydrogen needs to be produced, stored, and transported. Scientific and political discourses range from “hydrogen technology will provide us with the abundance of energy” to “building up hydrogen infrastructure including the necessary renewable energy sources is inefficient and will not lead to any kind of abundance.” For sure is that a fundamental change toward hydrogen as an energy carrier will have deep consequences for consumption and production patterns, global trade, and the reconfiguration of infrastructures.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Climate change and the limitations – physically and politically/economically - of fossil fuels foster the need to decarbonise and change to alternative energy production, storage, and carrier systems. Technology in renewable energy improves, and in general, energy efficiency is increasing, but currently, absolute demand for power is increasing.</p>
<p>The technology to form Hydrogen is improving, and more units are built. Also, catalyst technology is advancing. One must expect strong opposition from current stakeholders in fossil and nuclear technology. Although, there is also the option to use nuclear power to form Hydrogen, which many people see as critical. Investments in the infrastructure are high. While mixing Hydrogen with methane for heating is almost feasible today with minor adaptations to the gas pipelines, building up an entire parallel infrastructure for handling pure Hydrogen safely is a massive adaptation in infrastructure. It remains unclear how a transition can be managed and financed and if access to critical raw materials is given. Before hydrogen technology could enter the market in full force, the low efficiency in converting power to Hydrogen power needs to be improved or compensated.<br><br>Renewable energy production and catalyst technologies require rare earth metals, precious metals, and large amounts of copper, aluminium, and even sand for construction. Most of these raw materials cannot be found within the EU. How to secure access to these raw materials when there is a race for these resources? In addition, the EU has only limited potential for renewable energy production. Harvesting consequently, e.g., solar energy potentials, would transform the infrastructure significantly. One challenge might be that there could be a mismatch between the availability of solar or wind energy and water. Conflict regarding the use of water is likely in these areas. The electrolysis of water in massive quantities will also put pressure on the water system, which climate change impacts can worsen. In general, water might be scarce when there is more abundance of renewable resources.Any burning (also Hydrogen) under ambient air will lead to the formation of nitrogen oxide, which is a significant cause of air pollution (PM, acidification and eutrophication, precursor for ozone).</p>

<p>In the aftermath of decades of global integration, the model of hyperconnected markets is showing signs of retreat. Geopolitical instability, trade disputes, and resource scarcity are catalysing a structural shift that could reshape not only economies, but the very principles underpinning sustainability. Drawing from trend intelligence by Nextatlas, two pivotal developments emerge, developments that invite foresight professionals to rethink sustainability not as a static ideal, but as a dynamic field responsive to systemic transformation.</p>
<p><br>The post-global era is not simply a reconfiguration of trade routes or supply chains; it marks a fundamental reframing of what society deems “sustainable.” In a world where inflation, scarcity, and volatility dominate headlines, environmental goals are becoming increasingly intertwined with economic and geopolitical concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowhere is this reframing more evident than in the European Union, which has positioned itself as a global leader in linking sustainability with regulatory and economic frameworks. Through initiatives such as the European Green Deal, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and stricter ESG reporting standards, the EU is setting benchmarks that extend far beyond its borders and reshape how sustainability is understood in practice.</p>
<p><br>Nextatlas’ foresight model suggests a pivot: environmental degradation is no longer perceived as the singular sustainability threat. Instead, resource access, economic resilience, and supply chain transparency are becoming the new fault lines. This conclusion is grounded in more than a decade of Nextatlas’ machine learning work in cultural trend forecasting, built on a proprietary pipeline that ingests millions of data points each month from over 300,000 carefully selected sources, including social media users, niche influencers, scientific literature, design portfolios, and startup ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>Through natural language processing, semantic clustering, and visual analysis, these unstructured signals are structured into a dynamic semantic knowledge graph of thousands of interconnected micro-trends. By identifying early adopters with a demonstrated history of trend foresight, the model captures weak signals and emergent cultural dynamics before they reach the mainstream. With a 93% accuracy rate in trend prediction, this methodology provides a robust foundation for understanding the evolution from ecological awareness as individual virtue to sustainability as collective infrastructure.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Wasteless Economy</strong><br><strong>The intentional rejection of overconsumption</strong></p>
<p>What was once framed as consumer minimalism is evolving into a more resilient, system-conscious behaviour: the Wasteless Economy. As global citizens face the tangible consequences of rising costs and diminished availability, consumption habits are adjusting accordingly. But unlike past recessions where thrift was reactive, today’s restraint is increasingly proactive and value-driven. In this new context, value is redefined by longevity, utility, and purpose. Careful selection, durability, and circular practices now consciously outweigh constant acquisition.</p>
<p><br>This transformation has implications beyond market dynamics. It reflects a recalibration of what constitutes value and well-being in an era of systemic constraint. The Wasteless Economy aligns closely with long-term sustainability goals, emphasising durability, circularity, and resource efficiency, not just as ethical choices, but as strategies for social and economic stability. Amid persistent inflation and renewed tariffs on consumer goods, households are tightening their belts and are naturally drawn to buying less, buying smarter, and investing in lasting value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feeling the squeeze of both rising operational costs and evolving regulations, businesses are pivoting toward circular models, designing for durability, repairability, and reuse, not for sustainability branding, but as a smart financial strategy. Circular design reduces exposure to volatile supply chains and tariff-prone imports, while reinforcing consumer loyalty through accountability.</p>
<p><br>This shift is most visible in food &amp; beverage, fashion, and retail, industries where overproduction and disposability once defined the norm. Food companies must now design out surplus, embracing precision, seasonality, and resourcefulness as new standards of value. In fashion, longevity and modularity are replacing trend cycles, with resale and repair moving from fringe to fundamental. Retailers, in turn, are being called to transform from providers of endless choice into curators of care, offering fewer but better options that align with the values of restraint and longevity.<br></p>
<p>For foresight practitioners, the shift underscores a key signal: in strained environments, sustainability flourishes not through moral appeal but through necessity. Efforts to design policy or governance around future-proofed systems must therefore centre not only on carbon metrics, but also on material longevity, repair ecosystems, and new models of sufficiency.<br></p>
","<p><strong>The Imperative of Transparency</strong><br><strong>Sustainability’s evolution from branding to verification</strong><br></p>
<p>Transparency is becoming a legal, cultural, and technological expectation for private enterprise. From France’s recent fast fashion legislation to the EU’s push for Digital Product Passports (DPPs), accountability is now embedded in policy instruments.</p>
<p><br>Sustainability used to be symbolised by green logos or “eco-friendly” labels. Today, consumers have moved past basic messaging and want to know what the materials are, where they came from, how they were used in the production process, and their carbon impact. Transparency is now the evidence layer of sustainability; it gives people the means to judge ethical alignment, not just accept corporate messaging. Transparency connects sustainability to economic justice, worker rights, and accountability, making the act of purchasing inherently political and values-based.</p>
<p>The broader foresight implication is that sustainability is shifting from a narrative framework to a measurable, auditable infrastructure. Consumers are demanding not only clearer labels, but deeper visibility into supply chains, emissions footprints, labour practices, and lifecycle impacts. This transformation situates sustainability within broader discourses of justice, equity, and trust more than ever before, especially impacting industries where these values are most expressed by consumers, such as beauty and technology.</p>
<p><br>As tariff changes bring supply chains into public consciousness in a way previously unseen in modern times, choices that reflect values, especially climate resilience, equity, and integrity, become paramount. This supports a growing values-driven economy, where consumers act as watchdogs and advocates through social media and online campaigns, ever responsive to companies, products or marketing campaigns that don’t meet the mark. It also explains why sustainability still matters, even during economic uncertainty. <br><br>In future thinking, transparency functions as a foundational pillar of systemic resilience. It empowers both consumers and institutions to make decisions that are data-informed and values-aligned. Whether through civic regulation of labour practices or AI-driven traceability systems in supply chains, we are seeing the early stages of a world where opaque systems are increasingly untenable.</p>
","<p><strong>Implications for Policy and Foresight</strong><br><br>To keep pace with these shifts, sustainability frameworks must evolve beyond traditional carbon footprint metrics. Future-oriented strategies should integrate indicators such as equitable access to resources, the development of circular infrastructure, and the adaptability of systems under both economic and environmental stress. Longevity, seasonality, and resourcefulness are emerging as new markers of value in an increasingly strained global system. These dimensions reflect a new and broader understanding of sustainability as resilience in the face of systemic economic shocks.<br><br>For Europe in particular, this reorientation resonates with ongoing policy debates. The European Union has already embedded resilience into its strategic agenda through the Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the Fit for 55 package, yet these initiatives now face the challenge of integrating sufficiency and systemic durability alongside decarbonisation. Anticipatory governance in the EU will therefore need to reckon not only with ecological boundaries but also with the lived experience of scarcity. This means prioritising sufficiency and longevity over abundance, encouraging localised solutions, and supporting durability in both products and policies. Rather than focusing solely on environmental targets, future European systems should be designed to thrive amid constraints, turning production and consumption into investments in long-term value.<br><br>At the regulatory level, there is growing evidence that lawmaking itself is becoming a tool of foresight, as institutions reshape policies in line with long-term societal signals. The EU’s Digital Product Passport and the forthcoming Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation demonstrate how European policymaking is actively embedding traceability, repairability, and circularity into market rules. These measures, alongside national experiments such as France’s recent regulation on fast fashion, highlight how the European policy environment is translating weak signals into binding frameworks. Scaling this approach across high-impact sectors such as food, textiles, and technology will be essential for Europe’s ability to lead globally while safeguarding its own resilience.<br><br>Finally, trust will become a defining strategic asset in the years ahead. As consumers and citizens demand greater accountability, institutions that embrace transparency and invest in traceability will be better positioned to lead. In a world where legitimacy hinges on openness, building systems of trust is now a priority for true sustainability, and not just an ethical imperative.<br><br>The emerging face of sustainability is less about optics and more about operating systems. As the world shifts toward economic self-reliance and socio-political fragmentation, sustainability is adapting, moving from an external ideal to an embedded principle of resilience, equity, and systemic care. For those working at the intersection of futures studies, policy, and innovation, the trends explored here are both market signals and early indicators of how societies — and the European project itself — might thrive in an upcoming age of limits.<br><br>Resources: Nextatlas' <a href=""https://www.nextatlas.com/resources/trendreports/in-the-post-global-economy-is-sustainability-still-essential"" target=""_blank"">""In the Post-Global Economy, Is Sustainability Still Essential?""</a> free trend report&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

To enhance the resilience of these frameworks, the two-year study utilises a comprehensive set of methods, including impact wheel analysis, Ishikawa diagrams, cross-impact analysis, semi-structured interviews, and causal layered analysis. This approach reveals the cascading effects, entrenched cognitive biases, and intricate interdependencies present in policy design. These techniques facilitate a detailed examination of specific policy areas while providing a systemic perspective on how the connections among circular economy, bioeconomy, clean air and health, and the decarbonisation of transport impact overall sustainability results. By harnessing these diverse foresight techniques, the assessment reveals that conventional policy narratives are often oversimplified, obscuring risks and trade-offs that, if unchallenged, may impede a successful transition to a sustainable Europe. The impact wheel and Ishikawa diagrams facilitate the structured identification of primary and secondary effects, while the cross-impact analysis maps the interactive dynamics between assumptions. Semi-structured interviews provide nuanced stakeholder perspectives that uncover underlying worldviews and metaphors shaping policy discourse when synthesised via causal layered analysis. The study offers actionable recommendations for enhancing policy resilience, promoting integrated governance, and fostering adaptive strategies capable of addressing the multipronged challenges posed by environmental uncertainty.</p>

The Tri-Scope Synthesis method offers a robust framework combining critical, futures and exponential thinking, equipping leaders and organizations with the tools to anticipate and influence their futures effectively.</p>
","<p>The Tri-Scope Synthesis is a framework developed by futurist and advisor of the Special Secretariat of Foresight of the Hellenic Republic, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitriadis/"" target=""undefined"">Dimitris Dimitriadis</a>, designed to provide a practical tool for foresight practice. It integrates three distinct ways of thinking: critical thinking for unbiased analysis, futures thinking for exploring potential scenarios, and exponential thinking to anticipate rapid technological and societal changes. This combination enables the creation of strategies that are innovative, adaptable, and sustainable, effectively navigating the complexities of future challenges and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This framework enhances decision-making by grounding strategies in thorough, bias-free analysis, recognizing the exponential rate of technological and societal transformations, and ensuring adaptability to rapid shifts. It addresses the need for an advanced approach in today's fast-paced environment by incorporating comprehensive risk management, ethical considerations, and sustainability into the strategic planning process. By merging these diverse thinking modalities, Tri-Scope Synthesis not only anticipates future trends and disruptions but also crafts innovative, resilient strategies that are prepared to meet ethical and ecological demands, making it an essential tool for leaders aiming to effectively navigate the complexities of the modern world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article delves into the depths of the Tri-Scope Synthesis, illustrating its application through a hypothetical scenario in the renewable energy sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Tri-Scope Synthesis Framework</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Foundation in Critical Thinking</strong></p>
<p>At the core of the Tri-Scope Synthesis is critical thinking, which provides the groundwork for objective analysis. This stage involves scrutinizing current data, trends, and assumptions to identify biases and blind spots. It emphasizes rigorous evaluation of risks and implications of new trends and innovations, ensuring that decisions are well-informed and reflect reality, not just optimistic projections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>2.</strong> <strong>Integration of Futures Thinking</strong></p>
<p>Futures thinking expands the vision, enabling organizations to look beyond the immediate horizon. This component of the Tri-Scope Synthesis involves developing multiple long-term scenarios, including potential, probable, and preferable futures. Strategic foresight is applied to anticipate changes and challenges over extended periods, incorporating broad societal, economic, and environmental factors into planning. This helps in crafting strategies that are resilient and adaptable to expected and unexpected changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> <strong>Application of Exponential Thinking</strong></p>
<p>Exponential thinking addresses the rapid acceleration of technological and market changes, identifying areas where growth may not just be linear but could potentially explode—such as in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, or renewable energy technologies. In the framework, the emphasis on designing strategies that are scalable and adaptable is crucial for organizations to thrive amid rapid technological evolutions. Scalability ensures that strategies can expand in capacity and scope without losing effectiveness as demands increase or as opportunities for growth emerge. Adaptable strategies, on the other hand, allow organizations to modify their approach as new information becomes available or as external conditions change. This flexibility is vital for areas such as renewable energy technologies, where regulatory shifts and technological breakthroughs can quickly redefine the market landscape. By prioritizing scalability and adaptability, organizations can create dynamic systems that not only withstand rapid change but also harness it to drive innovation and growth, positioning themselves as leaders in their respective fields.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong> <strong>A Synthesis for Strategic Decision-Making</strong></p>
<p>In this final phase, insights from various fields are integrated to formulate strategies that are not only innovative but also sustainable and ethically sound. For example, consider a tech company that develops AI-driven solutions to optimize energy use in urban developments. The innovative aspect of the strategy involves using cutting-edge AI to analyze data from sources such as weather patterns, energy consumption, and traffic flows to dynamically adjust energy usage, reducing waste and optimizing efficiency. However, the sustainability and ethical soundness of the strategy come into play by ensuring these AI systems promote energy equity and do not disproportionately benefit wealthier neighborhoods over less affluent ones. Moreover, the company commits to transparency about data usage and safeguards privacy, addressing potential ethical concerns around surveillance and data security. By integrating these considerations, the strategy not only pushes the envelope on technological innovation but also upholds high standards of sustainability and ethical responsibility. This ensures long-term viability and acceptance of the technology in society, fostering trust and cooperation from various stakeholders and community members, which are crucial for the successful implementation and scalability of such projects. The outcome is a set of strategic plans that are flexible, allowing organizations to pivot and adapt as scenarios evolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A practical implementation example: Transitioning to Renewable Energy</strong></p>
<p>Consider a scenario where a company is transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The following process presents how the Tri-Scope synthesis could be applied to integrate a detailed and strategic approach for this transition, specifically focussing on identifying and incorporating pivotal innovations:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Critical Analysis of Current Capabilities and Market Conditions Assessment of Infrastructure:</strong> The company would start by evaluating its existing infrastructure and technology to determine how they can be adapted or need to be replaced for renewable energy production. This might include assessing the potential for retrofitting existing power plants with renewable technology or repurposing sites for solar or wind farms. A market and competitor analysis would aim to understand market demands, regulatory requirements, and competitor actions. This would involve analyzing trends in energy consumption, government incentives for renewable energy, and actions taken by competitors in the renewable space.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Futures Thinking for Scenario Planning: </strong>The company would develop scenarios based on different market and regulatory futures. For example, one scenario might explore the impact of a new government subsidy for renewable energy, while another might examine the ramifications of technological breakthroughs in solar energy efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>3.</strong> <strong>Exponential Thinking to Identify Pivotal Innovations: </strong>Actively monitoring advancements in renewable energy technologies such as solar photovoltaic, wind turbine efficiency, or next-generation biofuels could reveal innovations that dramatically reduce costs or increase efficiency. For example, the adoption of battery storage technology that can efficiently store solar power during peak production times to be used during off-peak hours could be a game-changer. This innovation would allow the company to offer continuous power supply solutions, thus solving one of the major limitations of solar and wind energy.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Integration of Insights into Strategic Planning Flexible Strategy Development</strong>: Using the insights gathered, the company would design strategies that are adaptable to various future scenarios. This might include investing in modular renewable technology that can be scaled up or down quickly in response to market demand. Through cross-departmental collaboration, insights and data can flow seamlessly between departments such as R&amp;D, operations, and marketing to implement a unified strategy that aligns with both technological advancements and market needs.</p>
<p>Establishing a protocol for regular strategic reviews to assess the effectiveness of the renewable transition strategy against real-world outcomes and evolving scenarios would further be necessary to continuously update technological adoptions, re-evaluating market strategies, and refining operational practices accordingly. Implementing feedback mechanisms to gather insights from all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and community members, would also enable continuous improvement and strategy adaptation.</p>
<p>By integrating these insights, a company can ensure that its transition to renewable energy is not only aligned with current capabilities and market conditions but is also robust enough to adapt to future changes and leverage new opportunities. The company can then remain agile and forward-thinking, capable of leading in a dynamically changing energy market. By integrating critical, futures, and exponential thinking, the Tri-Scope Synthesis approach provides a structured yet flexible framework that can help organizations adapt and innovate in response to an ever-changing world.</p>

","<p>Social confrontations signify the struggle about how we want to shape our futures. Rooted in different narratives represented by different social groups they are often competing for the sovereignty of interpretation of what a particular future may look like and how we are to achieve it. These diverging perspectives are usually rooted in past collective experiences and value systems and their interpretations and constitute a point of reference for a personal identity that reinforces a person belonging to a certain group. Social confrontations are not a singular phenomenon; instead, we live in a world of multiple social confrontations, and they co-exist, overlap, and compete. The divides social confrontations create can go across all spheres of life: education, care, health, nutrition, energy, mobility, communication, race, gender, political power, migration, etc.</p>
<p><strong>This policy brief explores how these developments have been perceived in science and society and how they are likely to impact the futures of democracy in Europe. To this end, we present four scenarios that chart diverging pathways on how social confrontations could evolve in the next 15 years under various drivers and trends and what role they could play for the democratic development in the EU. Finally, the policy brief presents conclusions implications for R&amp;I policymaking from the scenarios. </strong></p>
<p>The four scenarios discuss various development paths - they are intended to explore divergent possibilities and do not constitute a normative position. They do not always depict a preferable future. From our view, <strong>scenario 1 (“A Resilient and Consensual European Confederation”) </strong>is the most positive one of the four and it is helpful to filter the preferable developments that can be influenced by R&amp;I policy making. But also, for the other three, less preferable scenarios (<strong>“European Democracy defending itself against totalitarian tendencies”, “The European Fortress”, “Cultural Hegemony Through Global Capitalism”</strong>) it is necessary to identify negative developments that could be contained or prevented by R&amp;I policy making. Each scenario is equally important, however, in that it explores alternatives.</p>
<p>In concluding we present<strong> implications for R&amp;I policy making in four categories</strong>. The first category raises the question how R&amp;I policy on the macro-level can have an impact toward more equity and equality and can shift the benefits of R&amp;I investment more towards society as a whole. This part discusses option on how to apply social criteria for public R&amp;I funds, such as human dignity, solidarity and justice, environmental sustainability, transparency and co-decision-making and their relevance for projects and companies. A further option is to combine social innovations with technological innovation in order to give marginalized groups a chance of participating from the benefit of innovation outputs.</p>
<p>The second part is dedicated to the notion of more democratisation and participation in the process of R&amp;I priority setting and how different social groups can be involved. This includes, for example, structures that prepare decision making on R&amp;I investments. New approaches to democratize the decision-making processes on how investments in R&amp;I are taken may lead the way forward. Tu such end, it might be important to include employees and other social groups in the decision-making process, so to have a better representation of people who will be affected by the consequences in the future, e.g. the younger generation. An additional set of suggested changes involves the governance structures of decision-making processes as such: new procedures need to be learned and taught to achieve results that are acceptable for society as a whole and for social groups in particular.</p>
<p>How R&amp;I policy could be geared towards the stimulation of more socio-ecological transformation is the focus of the third part, discussing the point on how to limit the footprint of R&amp;I outcomes. The climate crisis will be a major cause of adversity and desperation in oursociety in the future. It will bring about more inequity, more inequality and more social confrontation. Accordingly, containing and mitigating the effects of the climate crisis needs to be the focus of socially responsible R&amp;I policy that gives answers to the question if ecological transformation and economic growth are contradictions or if they can be reconciled.</p>
<p>The fourth and final part of the policy implications looks into some future European R&amp;I focus areas of relevance to the four scenarios, especially on artificial intelligence and technology platforms as well as on the future of housing and living. The latter one is discussing options of affordable housing that respond to the changing lifestyles and climate change paradigm. Topics for Artificial Intelligence and<br>Information Technology include new approaches to assess the quality and reliability of information and sources as well as socially responsible products that pay tribute to our diverse populations and cultures.</p>

The format of these workshops has been designed to allow for mutual exchange and learning among participants: a few keynotes as well as interactive sessions where all participants can share their experience, ideas and questions. <br><br>The series of events was organised as part of the project Eye of Europe, a Coordination and Support Action funded by the Horizon Europe Programme, aimed at enhancing the integration of foresight practices into science, technology, and innovation (STI) policymaking across the EU. The Technology Centre Prague (TC Prague, Czechia) together with the National Agency for Research and Development of Republic of Moldova as the local organiser have overseen organising this event. Technology Centre Prague, which is responsible for all the MLEs and their content, is a key Czech national think tank and academia-based NGO which has a long and rich experience in supporting knowledge-based policymaking as well as in foresight processes and expert-based forward-looking exercises and trainings. National Agency for Research and Development (NARD) is the Moldovan government authority responsible for implementing the national programme on research and innovation, promoting excellence, and supporting collaborative projects through competitive funding and partnership initiatives.</p>
<p>The topic of Foresight culture in Europe: How to use foresight for (STI) knowledge-based policy making? The topic brought discussions on importance of collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and industry experts in<br>foresight activities and explored ways to break down silos and promote knowledge exchange across disciplines in<br>Moldova as well as in the rest of Europe or even globally.<br><br></p>
","<p>On 23–24 October 2025, we gathered in Chișinău, Moldova, for the final chapter of the Eye of Europe Mutual Learning series. Hosted by the National Agency for Research and Development of Moldova, this two-day event brought together over 40 foresight practitioners, policy makers, and representatives from ministries and research support agencies across Europe. The agenda was rich with presentations, case studies, and interactive sessions exploring how foresight is shaping research and innovation policy in diverse national contexts—from Moldova to Austria, Czechia, Estonia, Poland, Romania, and beyond. The event was an opportunity to reflect on the many faces of foresight across Europe and to present the diversity of approaches that shape how we anticipate and plan for the future.<br>Key Objectives<br>•	Foster a shared European foresight culture supporting strategic R&amp;I policymaking.<br>•	Highlight diverse foresight practices and institutional approaches across member states.<br>•	Strengthen capacity for future-oriented policy design and implementation.<br>•	Transition from vision to action through practical foresight integration.<br>Key Takeaways<br>•	Foresight is a strategic tool for innovation policy, resilience, and inclusiveness.<br>•	There is growing momentum toward systematic foresight integration in governance.<br>•	Co-creation, citizen engagement, and knowledge exchange are vital for foresight maturity in Europe.<br>•	MLE in Chisinau highlighted the need to move from dialogue to tangible policy actions and institutional embedding. <br><br>The Eye of Europe project was recognised as a potential hub for foresight community-building and greater institutionalisation. <br><br></p>

To do this, a framework was constructed around the concept of ecosystem performance as driver of STI, instead of human performance. This places the attention on the flourishing of ecosystems that is deeply connected to human needs and wellbeing. </p>","<p>Identifying STI and policy directions for ecosystem performance entails a conceptualisation of what an ecosystem is, how an ecosystem flourishes and what is the relation between humans and nature. We selected, analysed, and categorised fourteen schools of thought that have guided human activities towards ecosystem stewardship. Three perspectives resulted from this effort:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Protecting and restoring ecosystems”, concerned with preservation of ecosystems by managing the impact from human activities;</li>
<li>“Co-Shaping socio-ecological systems”, concerned with simultaneous development of social practices and ecological processes towards resilience and sustainability renewal;</li>
<li>“Caring within hybrid collectives”, concerned with the establishment of caring relationships in new collectives with humans and other entities on an equal level.</li>

The reach of airborne pathogens and persistence of aerosolized particles suspended in the air are a significant concern for the spread of pandemic and seasonal respiratory diseases. This is particularly relevant in indoor spaces where most respiratory infections occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Controlling the transmission of airborne pathogens is therefore a cornerstone of public health efforts to manage and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ensuring safety and health for individuals and communities. Technologies that allow such control are essential to address the challenge. This report is the output of a comprehensive study which evaluates the potential of the current technology landscape for suppressing indoor airborne pathogen transmission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analysis outlines two main technology groups: those for detecting airborne pathogens and those for decontaminating air and surfaces. It identifies several key technologies in each group, and assesses their maturity, impact, and potential priority for funding. It outlines the drivers, enablers, and barriers for the development and adoption of these technologies, providing insights into factors that may influence their future implementation. It also explores forward-looking perspectives with scenarios for future health crises and offers recommendations for policy and research to address the challenges and leverage the opportunities in the field of indoor air quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study was conducted during 2024 by European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) and Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).</p>

<p>The scenarios in the report are based on an extensive co-creation process with more than 700 R&amp;I experts from the Western Balkans, representing academia, civil society, the private sector, international organisations, and central and sub-national governments. To provide inspiration for the implementation of future-proof R&amp;I policies, the report also includes initial roadmaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are designed to inspire decision-makers by setting targets and the actions needed to develop their R&amp;I systems for the benefit of all citizens in the Western Balkans. The project was launched in July 2020 and the final study was presented at the EU-WB Ministerial Meeting in October 2021.</p>

This initiative, called ‘</em><a href=""https://turismo.dianomarina.im.it/it/news/venerdi-della-conoscenza"" target=""_blank""><em>Fridays of Knowledge</em></a><em>’, aims to equip the  local community with scientific tools and knowledge to understand the risks and implications of new technologies in a dialogue together with students, academics, and journalists. Communication Manager for Fridays of Knowledge, Damiana Biga, tells Futures4Europe how this initiative sparks debates across different generations and backgrounds, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and curiosity.</em></p>
","<p><strong>How does “Fridays of Knowledge” aim to bridge the perceived disconnect and uncertainty towards the future in local community discussions?</strong> <br>‘Fridays of Knowledge’ was created to engage the public by stimulating a reflection on the implications of global changes and trying to overcome the perception that the future is far removed from the local context. The topics use a scientific approach, stimulated by the curiosity of the participants and allowing the public to better anticipate and prepare for change. The methodologies used to achieve this aim include preliminary briefings with students, moderated debates with experts, and open discussion sessions with the audience. Some of the topics discussed are for example the impact of global warming; renewable energy solutions and sustainable development strategies; ethical, economic and societal effects of AI, robotics and automation on jobs and decision-making.</p>
<p><br>‘Fridays of Knowledge’ incorporates elements of strategic foresight to help participants anticipate and engage with future developments. It builds on methodologies commonly used in foresight exercises, such as identifying emerging trends, technologies, and societal changes that could impact the future. Furthermore, the inclusion of students, politicians and experts promotes a participatory approach, ensuring that multiple perspectives contribute to shaping a shared vision of the future.</p>
<p><br><strong>Which strategies have been adopted to actively involve high school students in the project?</strong> <br>Before each meeting, students take part in preparatory briefings, which allow them to explore the topics in depth and formulate targeted questions. The conferences are opened by students themselves, who deliver presentations and readings, and activate the discussion. Furthermore, direct engagement with national and international experts and policymakers enables young people to gain awareness of future challenges and strategic foresight, making the experience even more engaging and educational. For example, some of the questions addressed revolve around the impact of artificial intelligence on job opportunities for young people and what skills should be developed in an increasingly automated world, or the challenges in making renewable energy sources more affordable and accessible to everyone. <br><br><strong>To what extent has young participation influenced the topics that are treated during the meetings?</strong><br>‘Fridays of Knowledge’ rely on a prestigious Scientific Committee that selects discussion topics based on public interest, with a specific focus on young people. Now in its third edition, the project has made it possible to evaluate which topics have been most appreciated by students and teachers in order to better tailor them to their context. The enthusiasm shown by students has led to a focus on current and relevant themes for their future, such as technological innovation and global challenges, climate change and sustainability, geopolitical and economic shifts, and health and biotechnology. Their active participation, with questions, made the debate more engaging, and the exchange with the teachers made it possible to adapt the content to better meet educational needs. <br> <br><strong>Which tangible results have emerged from the first three editions of “Fridays of Knowledge” in terms of awareness and community action?</strong> <br>Thanks to the active involvement of students, teachers and citizens  — as well as authorities, cultural associations and journalists — there was a growing interest in global challenges and the implications of emerging technologies. Constant participation enabled a more structured dialogue between young people, experts and decision-makers. Students are now more aware of future opportunities and risks and have developed a critical and proactive approach to innovation. Additionally, the availability of live-streamed meetings and archived recordings has expanded knowledge dissemination and strengthened the connection between schools, research, and the local community.</p>
<p><br><strong>How do you measure the impact of the project on the local community?</strong> <br>The steady involvement of students, teachers, and citizens from all over the province is monitored through in-person and streaming participation. With increased media (and social media) promotion and the exponential success of the project, the audience has more than doubled compared to the first edition of ‘Fridays of Knowledge’. Furthermore, the Scientific Committee analyses and measures interest in the topics based on the questions posed during debates and interactions with experts. The continuity of the project, the confirmation of regional sponsorship and the expansion of the network of schools and institutions involved represent other key indicators of success. The emergence of local initiatives inspired by the meetings also serves as concrete evidence of its impact on the community.</p>
<p><br><strong>How does “Fridays of Knowledge” collaborate with other European initiatives to strengthen local dialogues? </strong><br>A significant example of this enrichment is the connection with Eye of Europe. Some of the topics discussed at the Diano Marina meetings were anticipated or inspired by reflections that emerged in this European context. In addition, livestream meetings encourage wider participation, potentially beyond national borders. This synergy strengthens the community's role in the European debate on science, technology and the future.<br></p>

Developments in the world and NATO point to Europe’s vulnerability – one that has long been explained, but had yet to be taken seriously. The Russian invasion of Ukraine brought home the realization that the world system is at a crossroads. Talk of multi-polarity, turbulence and possible configurations of the global system has combined with the concern about the future actorness of the EU, or as the 2021 Strategic Foresight Report of the European Commission puts it: “the EU’s capacity and freedom to act”.<br><br>If new international blocks and confrontations emerge, this disruption might even go beyond Europe, threatening traditional values, as well as lives and material prosperity of many. While the sudden changes are pushing the EU to reassess its defense capabilities and take a military stance by providing weapons to Ukraine, they must also be seen against the backdrop of an accelerating climate crisis. Impacts of climate change are a direct threat to many regions in the EU, but they also put indirect pressure on migration and the economy. As the war is fueling climate change drivers, many Europeans are torn between contradictory moods: indifference and solidarity, fragmentation and cohesion, empowerment and desperation. <br><br>A important driver affecting the EU’s capacity to act is the US foreign policy. Will the US maintain its military influence in Europe, delivering weapons, personnel, and intelligence, as well as pursuing its interests in Eastern Europe or will it take a post-hegemonic position, withdrawing from the continent and leaving conflict resolution up to the EU and the rest of NATO? Such geopolitical reconfigurations are closely entangled with the domestic developments in the US. The EU’s dependence on the transatlantic partnership and NATO is both a source of strength and weakness. As the recent period has shown, an un-cooperative US President and an ambivalent US-China relationship might put the US in a position of dictating terms to the EU in the context of major geopolitical upheaval and reconfigurations, where the rise of new regional powers and the emergence of new actors create uncertainty about future coalitions.<br><br>However, the EU is vulnerable along several further dimensions: from access to resources to insufficient capabilities in key technologies including military technologies and dependence on the US for military deterrence, as well as on China for some basic communication technologies. The EU is faced with the urgency of reducing its economic and technological dependencies but the situation remains<br>delicate in the view of possible shifts in the US government policies and continued dependence on natural resources from other parts of the world. In taking on a more ethical global stance, the EU opens itself up to criticism about double standards and inconsistencies in its policy narratives.<br><br>There are already efforts underway to improve the preparedness and make the EU more ‘futureproof’, for instance by anticipating consequences of, and testing responses to, possible shocks and crises. While the EU is frequently assumed to be in a position to claim technological leadership, the arising key question is whether it will rethink its investment focus towards specific dual-use technologies, thus creating capabilities and becoming competitive in the domain of military technologies and industry. <br><br>These (and other) uncertainties feed the fear of the future and gives rise to the new geo-political realism: weaponization of everything, increased budgets for deterrence and budget cuts on sociopolitical matters. Accompanying energy shortages and reversing climate neutral energy policies are contributing to the looming economic crisis and societal fragmentation. A central question of the<br>near and long-term future is: what will the geopolitical power distribution look like? <br><br><strong>This report sketches some alternative scenarios of how the geopolitical reconfiguration might evolve in the coming 15 to 20 years. It is based on the work of a team of experts, covering different aspects of geopolitical reconfigurations and future challenges for the EU’s positioning. </strong>Next to individual papers as inputs to this report, several virtual and one in-person workshop were organised for further developing and consolidation of the main drivers as well as for developing diverging scenarios on the future of geopolitics and the role of the EU. Additional experts were included in the work as well and consulted to give feedback. A dedicated workshop with EU foresight experts from the Commission services and the member states, helped to provide important insights to complete the scenario development and outline some key policy options.</p>

","<p>Climate change impacts are one of the main threats to human society and natural ecosystems. Even though natural dynamics also have a substantial effect on climate, there is no doubt that current alterations of climate with the correlated impacts are manmade. Alongside continuing efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, there may be possibilities to geoengineer climate systems to reduce or mask the impacts of climate change. There are also strong arguments for large-scale changes in social practices for adapting to and mitigating climate change. The big challenge comes with the necessary scale of interventions as those changes need to be large-scale and global, putting new challenges to all levels of governance from local to global.</p>
<p>Many present drivers seem to indicate a gloomy future for the climate. The current individualistic mindsets drive overconsumption and overproduction. The offsetting of carbon emissions is sometimes used to compensate for dirty activities. Intense competition for natural resources is not safeguarding their sustainability. Bio-holistic worldviews confront anthropocentric views, but climate delay has emerged as the new denial and the lack of courage to address climate supremacists, i.e. the global wealthy, shows little change of direction. According to a 2020 report from Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute, the wealthiest top 1% were responsible for 15% of global emissions, nearly twice as much as the world’s poorest 50%, who were responsible for just 7%. Overly optimistic beliefs in tech or social transformation to solve it prevail, and there is a wide reluctance to consider broad system change.</p>
<p>There are also drivers towards desired futures. Improved understanding of climate and global change and the capacity and knowledge to purposefully shape nature and society provide better means to address climate change. Climate anxiety and perception of government inaction have triggered, for instance, the ‘Fridays for future’ movement, which contributes to the emergence of global conscience on the climate and biodiversity crisis and the need for justice. New understandings of human purpose and fairness also encourage the development of a wider range of responses like de-desertification, seaweed permaculture, ocean fertilization, carbon capture and storage, and solar radiation management. We may learn to protect the global commons, including indigenous cultures and atmospheric commons.</p>
<p>Economic growth in societies based on individual material gain, here-and-now-thinking, short political cycles, and lack of broad political agreement on alternative paths seem to keep us on the path to the climate crisis. Furthermore, exacerbated social inequalities may lead many to have no willingness or ability to participate in transitions. While we are overconfident with systems’ design, we underestimate natural forces and ecosystems. Emerging options for large-scale ‘geoengineering’ interventions in the climate system promise new opportunities and new risks, including novel geopolitical tensions.There are diverse perceptions on geoengineering and possible social change towards potential acceptance or societal rejection. The planet lacks a fair and appropriate governance structure providing a framework on who might be entitled to carry out geoengineering projects in the name of the planet and what their responsibility is. There is no sufficient dialogue on what it means to be a responsible company, researcher, research organisation, or policy-maker in this context.</p>

The COVID-19 global pandemic has brought sudden disruption and heightened uncertainty on top of existing transformational changes such as digitalisation, geopolitical realignments, rising social inequalities and division, environmental crises and new threats to democratic governance. In this context, organisations everywhere face the challenge of modernising and adapting to remain relevant, without knowing what the future will look like or entail. The OECD in particular is entering an important period for reflection about its future, coinciding with the Organisation’s 60th anniversary and transition to a new Secretary-General.<br><br>This report uses a strategic foresight approach to inform reflection on how best to prepare the OECD to meet the needs of a highly unpredictable future. It was developed by the OECD’s Strategic Foresight Unit to demonstrate how navigating the future of global collaboration and the Organisation’s role within it will require ongoing exploration and dialogue about what may be possible, and desirable, in the future.<br><br>The report begins by exploring drivers of change that could significantly affect the future of global collaboration in public policy. For example, geopolitical realignments and heightened rivalries may undermine trust just as emerging risks to humanity make global collaboration more essential than ever before. The growing centrality of digital technologies may lead countries to develop separate digital ecosystems, threatening interconnection and interdependence between states. Platform companies are gaining significance in – and influence over – human lives, and may be poised to play an even greater role in shaping global standards and societal outcomes. Accelerated uptake of virtual reality could create new patterns of human settlement and interaction, and foster new powerful social movements and identities. Finally, an emerging bioeconomy and circular economy may transform global value chains, while a rapid expansion of private sector involvement in space opens new areas of economic activity.<br><br>Next, the report presents three scenarios for how the world could be very different than expected in 2035. While representing just three of an infinite number of possibilities, these scenarios were selected and developed for their potential to challenge current assumptions and raise important questions for the future of global collaboration and the OECD.<br><br>1.Multitrack World explores a scenario where humanity has formed into several separate and largely parallel clusters, each operating within its own data infrastructure and digital ecosystem. This scenario raises questions about how the OECD could best serve as a bridge between competing entities, and how to advance universal global principles in a context of potentially diverging values and definitions of well-being.<br><br>2.Virtual Worlds explores a scenario where the majority of human experience takes place in highly immersive and engaging virtual reality spaces, and where there is strong pressure by citizens for such spaces to be globally connected and interoperable. This scenario raises questions about what kinds of governance may be needed to address policy issues in and concerning virtual space, and what relationships with non-state actors the OECD may need in order to make an effective contribution to global collaboration in this newly dominant dimension of human life.<br><br>3.Vulnerable World explores a scenario where humanity faces a number of critical existential threats and opportunities that require an unprecedented level of near-perfect global collaboration in order to safeguard its vital common interests. This scenario raises questions of how effective governance of the global commons can be realised in these key areas, and the potential contribution of the OECD.</p>
","<p>Taken together, these scenarios suggest a number of strategic considerations for how the OECD could prepare to meet the evolving needs of the global community in the face of a highly dynamic and uncertain future. These considerations relate to the purpose, values, representation, operations and future readiness of the Organisation.<br><br>In terms of purpose, the possibility of different future divisions and alliances in the global system suggest the OECD may need to strengthen its bridge-building role, particularly on key issues of global concern. This in turn requires an assessment of which values should guide various aspects of the Organisation’s work, with an emphasis on evidence-based analysis and well-being serving as a potential framework when working across competing economic and political systems.<br><br>In terms of representation, the OECD may need a greater ability to work closely with non-member governments and various non-state actors in a world where these have a growing influence over global policy standards and outcomes. The scenarios also raise a number of operational considerations, including ensuring the OECD’s capacity to play a leadership role in virtual space. Finally, the scenarios suggest the OECD needs to strengthen its ability to prepare for uncertainty and respond to emerging priorities such as existential threats.<br><br>The aim of this paper is to inform discussion on how best to prepare the OECD to meet the needs of a highly unpredictable future. Its intended audience is all those who have a stake and role in decisions about the future of the Organisation. This includes first and foremost member countries and OECD management and staff, but also the much broader community of countries, organisations and citizens who participate in and benefit from the activities of the OECD.</p>
